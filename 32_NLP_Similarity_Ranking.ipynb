    "The previous notebook discussed Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Bag of Words (BoW) model in more detail. Recall that NLP refers to the process and data transformation that a system and algorithms perform to understand, and extract meaning and insights from unstructured data (e.g., text, language, etc.). In the case of BoW it converts text tokens (e.g., words, terms, phrases, sentences, etc.) into a matrix with their vector or numerical representation. The resulting vector matrix can then used for various tasks including but not limited classification, clustering, recommendation, ranking (e.g., based on similarity), question answering, text summarization, and generative (e.g., given a prompt generate text, image, sound, and video). Note that in large language model (LLM) space, some of these tasks are called fine-tunning. This notebook discusses the BoW model can be used for performing similarity ranking/searching tasks."

    "Similarity ranking refers to a technique of using cosine similarity metric to measure how similar one collection of text (e.g., sentence, paragraph, document) to another collection of text. Besides similarity ranking it may be called in various other ways such as similarity, similarity searching, document similarity, cosine similarity, among other. This section shows a simple example and then uses the health dataset from the previous notebook to perform an actual similarity search."

It´s only just sinking in,\" said Matthews. \"I was close to giving in at this race after I had two bad crashes two years and one year ago. I thought maybe this race is not for me but today my dream came true. <br/> \"It was never the plan to go for a breakaway today. We wanted a bunch sprint finish but we´re such a strong group of guys.It was a high calibre six-man sprint containing four former Tour stage winners, while Impey once wore the race leader´s yellow jersey.That remained with Froome, with his British countryman Adam Yates, who also rides for Orica, second at 16sec and Dan Martin of Ireland third overall at 19sec. </td>\n",

He said efforts are afoot to enhance the reserves to over 20 billion dollars very soon.Regarding energy crisis, Dar was confident that 10,000 megawatt of electricity will be added to the grid by December, 2017.    \r\n",

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things.

       "      <td>strong&gt;MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.&lt;/strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong&gt;FAILED EXPERIMENTS&lt;/strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON: Pakistan off-spin great Saqlain Mushtaq is set for another spell as an England coaching consultant, highlighting how fluid national allegiances can become when a cricketer´s playing days are over.Saqlain was brought in by England ahead of the recent second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford.In the build-up he found himself working with both off-spinner Moeen Ali and leg-break bowler Adil Rashid, although only Ali of the pair made it into the XI that won by 330 runs with more than a day to spare to level the four-match series at 1-1.Saqlain´s former Pakistan team-mate Mushtaq Ahmed, is carrying out a similar role with the tourists in more of a permanent capacity.Prior to taking up his Pakistan role, former leg-spinner Mushtaq was England´s spin-bowling coach.Off-spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan, Test cricket´s all-time leading wicket-taker, has come under fire for working with Australia in their ongoing series in his native Sri Lanka.By contrast the atmosphere between English and Pakistani officials has been far more cordial.That´s partly because, as this is Pakistan´s first tour of England since their infamous 2010 spot-fixing debacle at Lord´s, both sides are desperate to let their cricket do the talking.It is also a reflection of their multi-national backroom staffs, with England head coach Trevor Bayliss an Australian and his Pakistan counterpart, Mickey Arthur, a South African.Added to all that, Pakistan fielding coach Steve Rixon, the former Australia wicket-keeper, and Bayliss -- who made his name internationally as Sri Lanka coach -- were once team-mates in the same New South Wales side.</td>\n",

       "      <td>PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka: Australian captain Steve Smith named spin twins Nathan Lyon and Steve O´Keefe in his line-up Monday for the series opener against Sri Lanka as the newly-crowned kings of Test cricket look to cement their supremacy.On the day that Australia were presented with the mace as the world number one side, Smith took the unusual move of naming his starting XI a day before the start of the first Test in Pallekele, near Kandy.Australia´s rise up the rankings has been based in large part on the performance of their fast bowlers such as Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and they rarely field more than one spinner.But after taking 10 wickets in a warm-up last week, O´Keefe has been picked to play only his third Test alongside the more experienced Nathan Lyon -- his close friend and Sheffield Shield teammate.\"Both our spinners bowled well in the practice game. They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. It´s going to be exciting,\" Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lanka´s reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lanka´s premier spinner Rangana Herath.\"The wicket will take spin for sure here.

It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly.\"Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part-timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in.New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai, having played a two-test home series against Australia, during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket.Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20-over format.\"We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate. India is a strong side and Twenty20 cricket is fickle in nature,\" Williamson said.India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in bilateral series before winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, a run that saw them win 10 of their last 11 T20 matches.Batting stalwart Virat Kohli was confident the team can handle the burden of expectations.\"At home we expect that, we're prepared for that,\" Kohli said. \"The skill required is how you manage yourself off the field, because on the field is probably the safest and quietest for you, especially in your home country.\"The field is where you face the least pressure in big tournaments like this.\"We're taking some good momentum into the World Cup. The Asia Cup was a good preparation for us, getting a feel of playing against big teams. This is far more challenging, with teams from all over the world.\"</td>\n",

He bowled the fastest delivery of the tournament, clocked at 143 kilometres per hour.Joseph has played just eight first class matches, picking up 24 wickets at an average of a tad over 24.West Indies veteran Marlon Samuels described Joseph as young, fit, fast and fearless and chairman of selectors Courtney Browne thought the youngster was ready for promotion.\"We feel that Alzarri ",
       " will now benefit from the professional guidance of our coaching staff and the presence of fast bowling legend Joel Garner as manager,\" Browne said.Josephs addition brings the squad to 14 players, with nobody dropped after the first test, where India piled up 566 for eight declared.Shannon Gabriel was the only genuine quick in that line-up, backed by fast-medium exponents Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite.Early reports suggest the pitch at Sabina Park in Kingston may be green and give the fast bowlers some assistance in the second of the four tests in the series.West Indies also underperformed with the bat in the first test, compiling scores of only 243 and 231.Samuels, who scored one and 50, says it is time he raised his test batting to the level of his performances in Twenty20 and One Day Internationals.He averages only 33.39 in test matches, less than his ODI average and not far shy of his Twenty20 average.I havent been getting the runs Ive been looking for in the test arena but Ive been making up in the shorter version, the 35-year-old said.Its up to me to focus more and (put) in some big performance so the team can benefit.He said he felt a lot of pressure and was aware he needed to temper his aggression at times and focus on occupying the crease.Im batting at four, so I have to dominate. The responsibility is great so I have to change my game.</td>\n",

I have spent a lot of time outside and it hurts me when Pakistan loses.\"Ajmal said he bowled with weights strapped to his wrist and ankles to iron out kinks in his action, which he blamed on a broken wrist following a bus accident.He has had to sacrifice some bounce and spin, and the occasional delivery can exceed the 15 degree elbow extension limit but Ajmal said he still had enough variation to trouble batsmen.\"I will leave cricket with this (new) action.

But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to people´s homes. Evening games begin a few minutes after Muslims break their fast, a time most Tunisians spend with their families watching television.Television viewing in the region peaks during Ramazan with ratings remaining high well into the night and advertisers devote large chunks of their budget to the small screen´s high season.With most games showing on foreign satellite channels, the main Tunisian channels have scheduled daily analysis programmes on the matches.Ramazan hasn´t stopped people following the contest on big screens in the Gulf.In Kuwait, whose national team was banned by FIFA in October from taking part in World Cup qualifying matches because of alleged government interference in sports, fans take consolation in the Euros.Germany, the reigning world champions, are the most supported team in Kuwait and in many other Arab countries, exceeding defending European champions.In Dubai, one restaurant has erected a huge tent on the beach with big screens to show the games.</td>\n",

So it was good on that point and it was a massive confidence boost.\"It seems a lot longer than it has been. I thought I was going to be back earlier than I was, purely because of how good the rehab was in the first few weeks. I am here now and I´m back fully fit.\"England are 1-0 down in the four-match series and Stokes is in line for a recall to bolster the home side´s batting as much as for his lively pace bowling.\"Losing is something that we can´t afford to do but we have have been playing some good Test cricket over the last two years,\" he said.\"It´s one defeat, we are not taking it to heart, we´re just treating it as a three-match series and hoping we can win it.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;SYDNEY: Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Year´s test starting this weekend.&lt;/strongAn inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen O´Keefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australia´s victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner O´Keefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.O´Keefe´s inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON: England are seeking more regular help for their spinners after recruiting former Pakistan bowler Saqlain Mushtaq for the Old Trafford Test which starts on Friday.Saqlain linked up with England for practice in Manchester today and will work with spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, as well as advising batsmen how to play Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah.England have not had a permanent spin coach since Mushtaq Ahmed returned to Pakistan at the start of 2014 and they are keen to address the situation. It is thought a coach will join the squad for the winter tours of India and Bangladesh, where spin will be prominent. Saqlain is one of the contenders for the role while Daniel Vettori, the former New Zealand left-arm spinner, recently spent time with the England Performance Programme at a training camp in Dubai. Robert Croft, who played 21 Tests, was recruited for a part of last winters tour of South Africa. Mushtaq Ahmed worked closely with Graeme Swann during his time with England, helping Swann become one of the worlds best spinners. England know Moeen needs mentoring, especially as he has struggled to make an impression with the ball since England regained the Ashes last summer.Rashid has played only three Tests, against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates last autumn, but is back in the squad for Old Trafford as England look to square the Investec Series, which Pakistan lead 1-0. Former England pace bowler Andrew Caddick will spend a day with the team before the Third Test at Edgbaston, which starts on August 3.Caddick has been invited for the training session on August 1, in which he will observe the session and work alongside Englands fast bowlers. Caddick took 234 wickets in 62 Tests and was part of an effective new-ball combination with Darren Gough under the captaincy of Nasser Hussain. Meanwhile, England head selector James Whitaker is ready to clarify the role of his panel next week when he names the squad for the Third Test. Whitaker and fellow selectors Angus Fraser and Mick Newell were criticised for leaving Jimmy Anderson out for the First Test at Lords, even though the paceman had declared himself fit to play.</td>\n",

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things. I would be more than happy to help them get better in their skill not just from the bowling perspective but batting and fielding as well, Azhar added.   \n",

       "1827  strong>MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.</strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.   \n",

They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. It´s going to be exciting,\" Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lanka´s reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lanka´s premier spinner Rangana Herath.\"The wicket will take spin for sure here. Not sure about the first innings, but it looks very dry and lots of cracks on it. It certainly will help spin bowlers,\" Smith added.\"They (Sri Lanka) have some quality spinners in their rank led by Rangana Herath. He has done really well in these conditions. The batters need to have some good plans against him at what he is going to bring at us.\"Smith confirmed that vice-captain David Warner will play after being sidelined for six weeks with a broken left index finger.Mathews held back from naming his starting XI and was instead cursing a new round of injury woes to an already depleted squad.Fast bowler Suranga Lakmal complained of a stiff hamstring after training on Sunday before the uncapped Dhananjaya de Silva hurt his finger during fielding drills, Mathews revealed.Australia XI: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Joe Burns, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill, Steve O´Keeffe, Mitchell Starc, Adam VogesSri Lanka squad: Angelo Mathews (captain), Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Janith Perera, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Suranga Lakmal       \n",

It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly.\"Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part-timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in.New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai, having played a two-test home series against Australia, during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket.Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20-over format.\"We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate. India is a strong side and Twenty20 cricket is fickle in nature,\" Williamson said.India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in bilateral series before winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, a run that saw them win 10 of their last 11 T20 matches.Batting stalwart Virat Kohli was confident the team can handle the burden of expectations.\"At home we expect that, we're prepared for that,\" Kohli said. \"The skill required is how you manage yourself off the field, because on the field is probably the safest and quietest for you, especially in your home country.\"The field is where you face the least pressure in big tournaments like this.\"We're taking some good momentum into the World Cup. The Asia Cup was a good preparation for us, getting a feel of playing against big teams. This is far more challenging, with teams from all over the world.\"   \n",

       " will now benefit from the professional guidance of our coaching staff and the presence of fast bowling legend Joel Garner as manager,\" Browne said.Josephs addition brings the squad to 14 players, with nobody dropped after the first test, where India piled up 566 for eight declared.Shannon Gabriel was the only genuine quick in that line-up, backed by fast-medium exponents Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite.Early reports suggest the pitch at Sabina Park in Kingston may be green and give the fast bowlers some assistance in the second of the four tests in the series.West Indies also underperformed with the bat in the first test, compiling scores of only 243 and 231.Samuels, who scored one and 50, says it is time he raised his test batting to the level of his performances in Twenty20 and One Day Internationals.He averages only 33.39 in test matches, less than his ODI average and not far shy of his Twenty20 average.I havent been getting the runs Ive been looking for in the test arena but Ive been making up in the shorter version, the 35-year-old said.Its up to me to focus more and (put) in some big performance so the team can benefit.He said he felt a lot of pressure and was aware he needed to temper his aggression at times and focus on occupying the crease.Im batting at four, so I have to dominate. The responsibility is great so I have to change my game.   \n",

I have spent a lot of time outside and it hurts me when Pakistan loses.\"Ajmal said he bowled with weights strapped to his wrist and ankles to iron out kinks in his action, which he blamed on a broken wrist following a bus accident.He has had to sacrifice some bounce and spin, and the occasional delivery can exceed the 15 degree elbow extension limit but Ajmal said he still had enough variation to trouble batsmen.\"I will leave cricket with this (new) action. If I am not effective, I will step aside and leave. \"The odd ball might have exceeded 20 degrees but I work hard immediately to rectify that. I watch every video of my matches. Ninety-nine per cent of my deliveries are under control.   \n",

We're pretty much ready for it.\"Ashwin takes \"a lot of pride\" in being the leader of the pack and said he has learnt quite a lot since former spinner Anil Kumble took over as the new India coach last month.\"He has brought in a lot of energy and meticulousness,\" Ashwin said of the former India captain who begins his year-long tenure with the West Indies tour.\"He has already started bowling in the nets, which is something I pick out notes from. So far, he has provided me with a lot of confidence and a lot of responsibility.\"It's been more of giving me the license to try and express myself, which is something I really relish.\"   \n",

But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to people´s homes. Evening games begin a few minutes after Muslims break their fast, a time most Tunisians spend with their families watching television.Television viewing in the region peaks during Ramazan with ratings remaining high well into the night and advertisers devote large chunks of their budget to the small screen´s high season.With most games showing on foreign satellite channels, the main Tunisian channels have scheduled daily analysis programmes on the matches.Ramazan hasn´t stopped people following the contest on big screens in the Gulf.In Kuwait, whose national team was banned by FIFA in October from taking part in World Cup qualifying matches because of alleged government interference in sports, fans take consolation in the Euros.Germany, the reigning world champions, are the most supported team in Kuwait and in many other Arab countries, exceeding defending European champions.In Dubai, one restaurant has erected a huge tent on the beach with big screens to show the games.   \n",

So it was good on that point and it was a massive confidence boost.\"It seems a lot longer than it has been. I thought I was going to be back earlier than I was, purely because of how good the rehab was in the first few weeks. I am here now and I´m back fully fit.\"England are 1-0 down in the four-match series and Stokes is in line for a recall to bolster the home side´s batting as much as for his lively pace bowling.\"Losing is something that we can´t afford to do but we have have been playing some good Test cricket over the last two years,\" he said.\"It´s one defeat, we are not taking it to heart, we´re just treating it as a three-match series and hoping we can win it.\"   \n",

It is thought a coach will join the squad for the winter tours of India and Bangladesh, where spin will be prominent. Saqlain is one of the contenders for the role while Daniel Vettori, the former New Zealand left-arm spinner, recently spent time with the England Performance Programme at a training camp in Dubai. Robert Croft, who played 21 Tests, was recruited for a part of last winters tour of South Africa. Mushtaq Ahmed worked closely with Graeme Swann during his time with England, helping Swann become one of the worlds best spinners. England know Moeen needs mentoring, especially as he has struggled to make an impression with the ball since England regained the Ashes last summer.Rashid has played only three Tests, against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates last autumn, but is back in the squad for Old Trafford as England look to square the Investec Series, which Pakistan lead 1-0. Former England pace bowler Andrew Caddick will spend a day with the team before the Third Test at Edgbaston, which starts on August 3.Caddick has been invited for the training session on August 1, in which he will observe the session and work alongside Englands fast bowlers. Caddick took 234 wickets in 62 Tests and was part of an effective new-ball combination with Darren Gough under the captaincy of Nasser Hussain. Meanwhile, England head selector James Whitaker is ready to clarify the role of his panel next week when he names the squad for the Third Test. Whitaker and fellow selectors Angus Fraser and Mick Newell were criticised for leaving Jimmy Anderson out for the First Test at Lords, even though the paceman had declared himself fit to play.   \n",

This is the second best bowling performance by any Bangladeshi bowler after Ilyas Sunnys five for 13.The main scorers for New Zealand were Williamson (42), Colin Munro (35) and Ross Taylor (28).New Zealand, already through to the semi-finals with three wins in as many matches, made two changes to their side from their last game against Pakistan.They included an extra spinner in Nathan McCullum for paceman Adam Milne while Henry Nicholls came in for the in-form Martin Guptill, who was rested.Bangladesh, bottom of Group Two and seeking their first win in the group stages, made no changes to the team that lost to India by one run in a thriller in Bangalore on Wednesday.   \n",

The following steps are teh general steps performed in the previos NLP BoW model notebook and the functions input_bow_cos_calc() and rank_DATA() above. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Target text data that will be used for ranking is normalized (e.g., lemmatized and/or stemmed).\n",
    "2. Input Text is submitted and cleaned using the same normalization as the target text.\n",
    "3. Target Text is vectorized (i.e., bag of words matrix with TFIDF scores).\n",
    "4. Input text is vectorized using the same method as the target text.\n",
    "5. Calculation of similarity between the vectors (i.e., token dimensions) using a similarity metric (e.g., cosine).\n",
    "6. Display the ranked data or the target output. The target output may vary depending on what the system is used for. For example we may only need the ranking of the top 10 records. Another example, in a Q&A system a the similarity between an input query and the text in the database but the output may only need to be the answer pair for the top ranked results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above process creates various dataframes and variables that can be explored to understand what the model is doing but not needed in deployment. This section provides some discussion on each step of the backend process."

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things.

       "      <td>strong&gt;MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.&lt;/strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong&gt;FAILED EXPERIMENTS&lt;/strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.</td>\n",

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things. I would be more than happy to help them get better in their skill not just from the bowling perspective but batting and fielding as well, Azhar added.   \n",

       "1827  strong>MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.</strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.   \n",

    "There are other approaches that may leverage supervised ML, unsupervised ML and deep learning. Below are some thoughts on some other approaches that could be explored, evaluated and compared for model performance and computational requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Similarity Search Improvement: Tokens of Input Search\n",
    "One of the disadvantages of cosine similarity is that for large dataframes (i.e., above 1 million records) and depending on the parameters of the vectorization used to calculate the BOW matrix, the computational requriements may be too high. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach that could reduce computational requirements in these cases is to first calculate the BOW matrix tokens (e.g., text, words, terms, phrases, sentences) using the input text and then fit the records text data to that BOW. This will greatly limit the amount of tokens used in the vectorization by removing tokens that are not of interest of the query. This may increase performance but potentially at the cost of lower accuracy as it will be removing many tokens from the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note in this approach the order of the creation of the BoW matrix changes and the function input_bow_cos_calc_2 has been modified to take this change into account. In this case the BoW matrix is generated using the words and tokens of those words found in the input text query rather than on the full text of the dataframe. The dataframe vectors are then calculated only on the words of the input text. This results in a much smaller BoW matrix. The rest of the process and functions are exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one significant difference is that, for those articles that have words in the query, the resulting cosine score tends to be much higher. This is because the calculation of TFIDF values considers the total number of words within an article. For example, the term frequency is calculated by the division of how many times the term appears in the narrative divided by total number of terms. Total number of terms is determined by those terms modeled in the matrix and not all actual words. In this approach, since the total number of words is significantly reduced by only using the words of the query input text the TFIDF vectors results in much larger numbers. Using the other approach, penalizes or suppreses long articles while this approach may tends to ignore lenght of the article. "

       "      <td>PRETORIA:  South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada took a career-best 6-101 to leave England on 318 for eight wickets at tea and trailing by 157 runs on the third day of the fourth and final Test at Centurion Park on Sunday.Rabada had decimated the England middle-order before lunch, claiming the big wicket of Ben Stokes (33) during a rain-hit middle session, with the visitors reeling after the Proteas posted 475 in their first innings.Moeen Ali (45 not out) provided a steady hand in response and along with Stuart Broad (four not out) will look to close the gap on a wicket that was starting to favour the bowlers.England have already wrapped up the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead.Stokes looked at his fluent best before he was caught at slip by Hashim Amla shortly after South Africa, who posted a first innings total of 475, had taken the new ball.Chris Woakes (26) was the only other wicket to fall in the session and could count himself unlucky, an edge off the part-time spin of JP Duminy hitting the thigh of wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock and looping to Dean Elgar at slip.Rabada had removed Joe Root (76), James Taylor (14) and Jonny Bairstow (0) in quick succession in the minutes before lunch.Root had looked set for a big score but was caught by De Kock having a drive at Rabada after he had brought up his fourth half-century of the series.Taylor fell to the same combination trying to pull a short ball, before Bairstow got a feather edge through to De Kock.Rabada is just the second player in history to take six wickets in an innings in both tests and One-Day Internationals before the age of 21, joining Pakistan great Waqar Younis on that short list.Captain Alastair Cook (76) was the first wicket to fall on day three when he was caught behind by De Kock off the bowling of fast bowler Morne Morkel.Coming around the wicket to the left-hander, Morkel angled the ball into Cook´s body and induced an edge as it moved away slightly off the wicket.It left Cook still 41 runs shy of becoming the first England batsman to reach 10,000 test runs after he had put on 99 for the third wicket with Root.

       "      <td>strong&gt;Pakistan did all they could to get their World Twenty20 match against India moved to Kolkata, even threatening to withdraw, but poor selection and the hosts´ all-round superiority left them wishing they had not bothered to turn up at all.&lt;/strongThe most anticipated match of the tournament between the neighbours was shifted to Eden Gardens at the last moment over security concerns at the original venue at Dharamsala.Pakistan repeatedly emphasised India´s morale-sapping loss in the opener against New Zealand was an advantage for them and they were even more confident of breaking their jinx of losing every World Cup match between the bitter rivals.Their decision to play four fast bowlers against India reflected an approach more suited to the 1980s West Indies side and dropping spinner Imad Wasim at the expense of a paceman underlined their failure to read the surface.Asked to bat in the rain-shortened Group Two match, the 2009 champions were largely subdued once off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got the new ball to turn viciously.Doubts seemed to creep into Pakistan´s minds regarding what would be a decent target to set India, who folded for 79 against the Kiwis on a turning track while chasing 127 in their opener, and the innings never gained momentum until the death overs.MEAGRE TOTAL\"There are few areas we need to improve, specially our batting,\" said Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with a 26 for Pakistan.\"Even though it was a tough pitch to bat on, I believe we could have set a higher target.\"In the end, Pakistan could only manage a meagre 118 for five in their 18 overs, nowhere near enough without the bowling depth New Zealand could draw upon in Nagpur when their spinners picked up nine of 10 wickets to stun India.India did suffer a minor wobble though, slumping to 23-3 after Mohammad Sami dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive deliveries in the fifth over to silence the 60,000 crowd at Eden Gardens as well as the millions watching on TV.However, India´s batting mainstay Virat Kohli hit a prudent 55 not out to calm the nerves and showed why he is considered one of the world´s best.The right-hander, who averages almost 85 in T20s against Pakistan, was aided by the fact that he did not have to face too many deliveries from Mohammad Amir, whose opening spell of 1-3 ran shivers down India´s spines.The left-arm paceman was not brought back on by Shahid Afridi until India were nearing victory and the leg-spinning skipper, who lacks the guile to turn the ball effectively, was unable to stem the flow of runs himself.As the pressure lifted, India were easily able to maintain their utter dominance of Pakistan in World Cup events, adding a fifth World Twenty20 victory to the six triumphs in the 50-over format.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MELBOURNE: Australia´s cricket board will make it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Test batsman Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers and players fielding close to the wicket will also have to wear helmets in first class matches in accordance with the David Curtain review, which was released on Wednesday.The helmets, mandatory in games and during practice, must adhere to the highest British standard, Cricket Australia (CA) said.Hughes was struck on the back of the head by a rising delivery when batting for South Australia in a domestic match in November 2014.He died two days later in a Sydney hospital aged 25.\"There´s not a day that goes by where we don´t think of Phillip,\" CA boss James Sutherland told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.\"This report won´t bring him back and it won´t do anything to ease the pain of his family or his loved ones who miss him most.\"But we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\"Hughes´s death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who face fast bowling that can exceed 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).Hughes was wearing an Australian standard helmet when he was struck but the Curtain report said even the newer British standard helmet available at the time would not have afforded him extra protection from the blow.The report also said an apparent delay in the arrival of the ambulance team that treated Hughes played no part in his death.\"I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,\" it said.The report also recommended wicketkeepers play with protective eye-wear but stopped short of endorsing the clip-on neck guards on the back of helmets, which some players have worn after Hughes´s death.Sutherland said CA still encouraged players to wear the guards but conceded, like the report, that more research was required to determine whether they actually increased safety.\"We´re certainly taking up the running on that to make sure we understand it better,\" he said.Sutherland said the board had also sought approval from the International Cricket Council to trial the use of injury substitutes who could bat and bowl in domestic games.Substitutes have been permitted to replace injured or ill players in matches for over 100 years but are not allowed to bat, bowl or act as wicketkeepers or captains, according to the laws of the game.Initially the substitutes would replace players ruled out by concussion but in future their use could be expanded to include other forms of injury, Sutherland added.</td>\n",

Deandra Dottin, who ensured West Indies were in with a chance by making 45 off 40 balls in the team's total of 114 for 8, then showed immaculate death-bowling skills to leave India short-changed.Shikha Pandey, who carved a boundary over point to bring it down to five off three balls was run-out off the next delivery to effectively dash India's hopes.India landed the early punches and weakened West Indies to 26 for 3 as the contest was reduced to a battle of spin attacks.The hosts then switched off for a bit, only to see Stafanie Taylor and Dottin regain lost ground, and then lift West Indies with a fourth-wicket partnership of 77.The stand helped West Indies post a total of 114 for 8, challenging, but by no means impossible.</td>\n",

The losing streak hung like Coleridge's albatross around their necks. They were desperate to shake it off.In their 21st match, against Hong Kong on an unexpectedly rainy night in Nagpur, they finally did it and exited the World T20 with an eight-wicket win, which was set up by a sharp bowling performance.The portents were clear right from the third ball of the match. Left-arm spinner Mark Watt gave generous flight as the ball gripped the cracked pitch and tested Jamie Atkinson with slow turn. Some balls turned like that, some skidded on, while others stopped on the batsmen.The trio of Watt, Con de Lange, and Matt Machan combined to send Hong Kong on a tail spin with figures of 12-0-66-4.Rain gave Hong Kong brief respite, and the contest was then reduced to a 10-over shootout, after which Scotland overhauled the revised target of 76 with ease.George Munsey kick-started the chase with a flurry of fours. By the time he holed out, Scotland had knocked off more than one fourth of their target. And by the sixth over Scotland had dashed past 50, with several of their players lining up by the edge of the boundary to celebrate.</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.&lt;/strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong&gt;FAILED EXPERIMENTS&lt;/strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda: West Indies were facing the prospect of another huge series-opening defeat at 21 for one in their second innings at stumps, a deficit of 302 runs, after being forced to follow-on on the third day of the first Test against India on Saturday.&lt;/strongFast-medium bowlers Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami took four wickets each to wreck the home side´s first innings, dismissing them for 243 in the final session of the day with half-centuries by opener Kraigg Brathwaite and wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich representing the only meaningful resistance.Brathwaite, who defied India´s array of pace and spin for almost five hours in getting to 74, could not survive the first over of the second turn at the crease, being trapped palpably leg-before by Ishant Sharma.\"It was a decent knock in the first innings but I would have loved to go on,\" said Brathwaite at the close of play.\"With three out-and-out pacers and two spinners, the Indians have a lot to choose from. They stuck to their plans very well. It was never easy batting against them.\"Rajendra Chandrika and Darren Bravo survived to the close and will resume on the fourth day hoping to put up a much more concerted effort than in the first innings.In their previous three Test series, the West Indies lost the opening matches at home to Australia by nine wickets a year ago and then by an innings in Sri Lanka and Australia at the end of 2015.India´s bowlers made a mockery of all the lamentations of a placid, lifeless pitch over the first two days with an impressive, purposeful effort throughout the day.They were held up though at the start of play as Braithwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo frustrated Virat Kohli and his men for 75 minutes until leg-spinner Amit Mishra had Bishoo stumped by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.It was second of six dismissals for Saha in the innings, putting him alongside Syed Kirmani and Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in a Test innings.From that point on it became a virtual procession of West Indies batsmen to and from the wicket with Shami outstanding either side of the lunch interval when he disposed of Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood to add to his dismissal of Chandrika late on the second evening.Debutant Roston Chase displayed a measure of grit in a 47-run stand for the sixth wicket with Brathwaite, but the reintroduction of Yadav for another spell in mid-afternoon proved telling.Chase miscued an attempted pull to give Kohli a simple catch at short midwicket and Brathwaite could not get out of the way of a sharp lifter to give a catch behind.Dowrich counter-attacked superbly in getting to an unbeaten 57 with ten fours by the time the innings folded, Yadav dispensing with Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite off successive balls before Mishra completed the job by bowling a heaving Shannon Gabriel.</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;LONDON: Mohammad Amir returned to the hallowed ground of Lord's he defiled six years ago to earn Pakistan one of their most memorable test triumphs over England on Sunday.&lt;/strongThe fast bowler, who served a five-year ban and jail time after admitting spot-fixing at the home of cricket in 2010, took the final wicket of the first test to give Pakistan a well-deserved 75-run victory.While Amir's return to the game divides opinion, it felt like partial redemption for the 24-year-old who was cleared to return to the sport last September and who was making his first test appearance since his ban ended.Amir removed the key wicket of captain Alastair Cook in the first innings, and then finished off England's resistance on Sunday as he destroyed Jake Ball's stumps to spark joyous scenes from the Pakistan fans.\"He's part of the team that has won the test match, it will be one of the memorable days of his life and from here he can start his career again,\" Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said.\"He's a good kid now, he's a mature cricketer and he can prove to everyone that he's a good bowler.\"Amir was touted as a potential great when he burst onto the international stage as a teenager, making his test debut at 17.But his world fell apart when he admitted to deliberately bowling no-balls against England and was convicted along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif who received seven and 10 year bans respectively.The conspiracy rocked world cricket and reputation of Pakistan cricket was tarnished, but Misbah said the victory at Lord's on Sunday completed a long journey back from the depths for a nation mad about the sport.\"It's been a remarkable turnaround after the 2010 incident,\" Misbah said.\"The team took real responsibility and these players showed a lot of respect for the game, fought throughout the six years and brought plenty of wins. Their on and off-the-field disciplines are really good.\"Winning against a top side, who are really good in their home conditions, speaks volumes for this team.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;WELLINGTON: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swing and seam friendly conditions, a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday.&lt;/strongThe Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just 48 hours out from the toss and, even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand's capital was expected to brown it off, McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat.Similarly-grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected, however, as both captains noted on Thursday.\"I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you'd expect,\" McCullum said. \"The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen ... (and) you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score.\"It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape.\"Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2-0 last November, Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket.Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle, Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, both of whom created doubt, and at times fear, in the minds of batsmen.Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement.Last year at Trent Bridge, Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8-15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings.\"We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so,\" Smith said.\"The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly, a lot better than we have in recent times.\"New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer, recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range.That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years.Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch.The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test, all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004.\"I'm looking forward to these two test matches,\" McCullum said. \"It will be a great series, two evenly matched teams.\"Not a better way to go out really.\"</td>\n",

But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.</td>\n",

When I was his coach he was an outstanding talent.That talent doesnt go away but it depends on how much you are motivated and how much you still want to do well.It wouldnt surprise me if Butt made a successful international comeback, Pakpassion.net quoted him as saying.Speaking about Muhammad Amir Lawson said he remembers Amir asa very young player who came to some of my practice sessions when I was coaching Pakistan.Amir was working with the Under 19s and even then looked very impressive.I am pleased that after a difficult period he has comeback bigger and stronger and is bowling terrifically well. It is also very good for Pakistan cricket that he is back he said.Talking about the attitude of some Pakistani players that has come into question after comments from some coaches Lawson said if people are not willing to work hard then there are enough good young players in Pakistan to replace them.Get people in who are motivated. If you arent playing for your country then there is no point in playing cricket.Pakistan has had some pretty successful times lately under Waqar Younis and Misbah ul Haq and one would hope that the players would continue to be motivated, he said.Commenting on the Day Night Test cricket he said he is surprised at the resistance of some countries.Well done to Pakistan in agreeing to play a Day Night Test match in Australia.The pink ball is not that different to a red ball in any case you just have to practice with it and its fine.We use red or white so why not use pink cricket balls Pakistan should be congratulated on agreeing to play in Australia with the pink ball he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;ANTIGUA:  India´s test ranking has long been based on their formidable home form but the side aim to impress new coach Anil Kumble by showing they can adapt to conditions outside the subcontinent in a four-test against West Indies starting in Antigua on Thursday.&lt;/strongFor the hosts, however, the task is more straightforward -- simply proving they can still be competitive in the long form of the game.Since last touring West Indies in 2011, when they ground out a 1-0 test series victory (with two draws), India have lost six consecutive series outside of Asia - two each in England and Australia and one each in South Africa and New Zealand.Their record in that time is one win, 15 defeats and five draws.That does not include a 2-1 series victory in nearby Sri Lanka last year, where conditions are typically similar to those encountered at home.Former leg-spinner Kumble was recently appointed head coach of the Indians, who are second behind Australia in the test rankings, after pitching a plan to fix that miserable away record.And while he has already moved to tighten discipline, introducing a fine of $50 for being late, he shies away from being branded a strict disciplinarian.\"All I know I am a cricket coach and whether I am strict or lenient, you will probably have to ask the team,\" he said recently.Kumble could hardly ask for a better chance to start the job on a winning note than against a West Indies team weakened by administrative conflict and the unavailability of several key players, with fast bowler Jerome Taylor the latest to retire from the test format.While West Indies excel in the Twenty20 format, they are eighth of nine nations in the test rankings, ahead only of minnows Bangladesh.Kumble has stressed his team must demonstrate patience throughout the series, a sentiment shared by West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.\"We expect to face a lot of spin against the Indians in this series, so it is about playing the waiting game,\" said Brathwaite, who blasted four sixes in a row against England to seal West Indies´ World Twenty20 triumph in April.\"We need to look to spend long periods at the crease so we are preaching that in the dressing room.\"After the first test in Antigua, the remaining tests will be played in Jamaica (July 30- Aug. 3), St Lucia (Aug. 9-13) and Trinidad (Aug. 18-22).strong&gt;SQUADS:&lt;/strongstrong&gt;West Indies:&lt;/strong&gt; Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Carlos Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Rajendra Chandrika, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Leon Johnson, Marlon SamuelsIndia.strong&gt;India:&lt;/strong&gt; Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Stuart Binny, Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Cheteshwar Pujara, Lokesh Rahul, Wriddhiman Saha, Rohit Sharma, Shardul Thakur, Murali Vijay, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CAPE TOWN: South Africa recorded their first ever women's T20 victory over England to level the three-match series at 1-1. In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal. More rain followed and the players did not get back on but South Africa's batsmen had earned their first win over England after 14 attempts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe: New Zealand wrapped up an innings victory against Zimbabwe in the first Test in Bulawayo on Sunday despite a maiden Test century from Sean Williams finally giving the hosts something to smile about.New Zealand bowled Zimbabwe out for 295 to win the game by an innings and 117 runs, with left-arm seamer Neil Wagner finishing with eight wickets in the match at Queens Sports Club.The second and final Test gets under way at the same venue on Saturday.After three days of brutal domination at the hands of the tourists, Williams rose from his sick bed to hit the fastest Test century by a Zimbabwean as he reached three figures in just 106 deliveries.The left-hander had spent the past two days off the field due to illness as New Zealand racked up a first-innings lead of 412, and came to the crease early on the fourth morning with Zimbabwe tottering on 124 for six, still needing 288 runs to make the Black Caps bat again.Williams added 118 for the seventh wicket with captain Graeme Cremer, who made 33, and went on to make 119 before succumbing to the left-arm spin of Mitchell Santner.</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;KARACHI: Pakistans legendary cricketer Wasim Akram, fondly remembered by his fans as 'Swing ka Sultan' turned 50 today.&lt;/strongThe left-arm pacer took to twitter to thank his friends and fans for the birthday wishes he received. dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"&gt; Wasim Akram (@wasimakramlive) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/wasimakramlive/status/738582745119498244\"&gt;June 3, 2016&lt;/aBorn on the 3rd of June 1966 in Lahore, he began his cricketing career in the 80s and retired in the year 2003. He remained the 'King of Swing' throughout his 19 year long career.In his cricketing career that spanned over almost two decades Wasim has taken a whooping 916 international wickets and to date continues to be an inspiration to aspiring cricketers.Wasim, considered to be the most prolific Pakistani fast bowler to have ever played the game, picked up an impressive 414 wickets in 104 test matches while in ODIs, he has notched up 502 wickets in the 356 matches that he played for Pakistan. At blistering pace, Wasim Akram's reverse swing deliveries bamboozled batsmen around the world and made him one of the most respected cricketers of all time. He also has the honour of being part of the 1992 World Cup-winning Pakistan cricket team, led by Imran Khan. Akram's three wickets in the final helped Pakistan clinch the match and the world cup. Wasim Akram captained Pakistan briefly after Imran Khan and Javed Miandad retired and led his side to the world cup final in 1999 but since then, match-fixing allegations and complications got in the way of his captaining the side ever again. He retired after the 2003 World Cup, when he was dropped from the national squad after Pakistan's dismal performance. Wasim has also been appointed as the bowling coach of the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders and frequently commentates as well. Wasim married Australian Shaniera Thompson in 2013 and has a daughter from her named Aiyla. He will always be included among not only the greatest cricketers to have emerged from Pakistan, but the world over.</td>\n",

He removed star West Indian batsman Chris Gayle in the first over. Gayle was caught by Englands James Vince for six with a four.Qalandar lost their second wicket on 37 when captain Azhar Ali was bowled by Shakib Al-Hasanfor 18.

Deandra Dottin, who ensured West Indies were in with a chance by making 45 off 40 balls in the team's total of 114 for 8, then showed immaculate death-bowling skills to leave India short-changed.Shikha Pandey, who carved a boundary over point to bring it down to five off three balls was run-out off the next delivery to effectively dash India's hopes.India landed the early punches and weakened West Indies to 26 for 3 as the contest was reduced to a battle of spin attacks.The hosts then switched off for a bit, only to see Stafanie Taylor and Dottin regain lost ground, and then lift West Indies with a fourth-wicket partnership of 77.The stand helped West Indies post a total of 114 for 8, challenging, but by no means impossible.    \n",

The losing streak hung like Coleridge's albatross around their necks. They were desperate to shake it off.In their 21st match, against Hong Kong on an unexpectedly rainy night in Nagpur, they finally did it and exited the World T20 with an eight-wicket win, which was set up by a sharp bowling performance.The portents were clear right from the third ball of the match. Left-arm spinner Mark Watt gave generous flight as the ball gripped the cracked pitch and tested Jamie Atkinson with slow turn. Some balls turned like that, some skidded on, while others stopped on the batsmen.The trio of Watt, Con de Lange, and Matt Machan combined to send Hong Kong on a tail spin with figures of 12-0-66-4.Rain gave Hong Kong brief respite, and the contest was then reduced to a 10-over shootout, after which Scotland overhauled the revised target of 76 with ease.George Munsey kick-started the chase with a flurry of fours. By the time he holed out, Scotland had knocked off more than one fourth of their target. And by the sixth over Scotland had dashed past 50, with several of their players lining up by the edge of the boundary to celebrate.   \n",

It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.   \n",

       "2307                strong>North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda: West Indies were facing the prospect of another huge series-opening defeat at 21 for one in their second innings at stumps, a deficit of 302 runs, after being forced to follow-on on the third day of the first Test against India on Saturday.</strongFast-medium bowlers Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami took four wickets each to wreck the home side´s first innings, dismissing them for 243 in the final session of the day with half-centuries by opener Kraigg Brathwaite and wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich representing the only meaningful resistance.Brathwaite, who defied India´s array of pace and spin for almost five hours in getting to 74, could not survive the first over of the second turn at the crease, being trapped palpably leg-before by Ishant Sharma.\"It was a decent knock in the first innings but I would have loved to go on,\" said Brathwaite at the close of play.\"With three out-and-out pacers and two spinners, the Indians have a lot to choose from. They stuck to their plans very well. It was never easy batting against them.\"Rajendra Chandrika and Darren Bravo survived to the close and will resume on the fourth day hoping to put up a much more concerted effort than in the first innings.In their previous three Test series, the West Indies lost the opening matches at home to Australia by nine wickets a year ago and then by an innings in Sri Lanka and Australia at the end of 2015.India´s bowlers made a mockery of all the lamentations of a placid, lifeless pitch over the first two days with an impressive, purposeful effort throughout the day.They were held up though at the start of play as Braithwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo frustrated Virat Kohli and his men for 75 minutes until leg-spinner Amit Mishra had Bishoo stumped by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.It was second of six dismissals for Saha in the innings, putting him alongside Syed Kirmani and Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in a Test innings.From that point on it became a virtual procession of West Indies batsmen to and from the wicket with Shami outstanding either side of the lunch interval when he disposed of Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood to add to his dismissal of Chandrika late on the second evening.Debutant Roston Chase displayed a measure of grit in a 47-run stand for the sixth wicket with Brathwaite, but the reintroduction of Yadav for another spell in mid-afternoon proved telling.Chase miscued an attempted pull to give Kohli a simple catch at short midwicket and Brathwaite could not get out of the way of a sharp lifter to give a catch behind.Dowrich counter-attacked superbly in getting to an unbeaten 57 with ten fours by the time the innings folded, Yadav dispensing with Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite off successive balls before Mishra completed the job by bowling a heaving Shannon Gabriel.   \n",

Their on and off-the-field disciplines are really good.\"Winning against a top side, who are really good in their home conditions, speaks volumes for this team.\"   \n",
       "1204                                               strong>WELLINGTON: </strong><strong>Swing and seam friendly conditions, a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday.</strongThe Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just 48 hours out from the toss and, even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand's capital was expected to brown it off, McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat.Similarly-grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected, however, as both captains noted on Thursday.\"I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you'd expect,\" McCullum said. \"The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen ... (and) you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score.\"It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape.\"Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2-0 last November, Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket.Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle, Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, both of whom created doubt, and at times fear, in the minds of batsmen.Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement.Last year at Trent Bridge, Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8-15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings.\"We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so,\" Smith said.\"The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly, a lot better than we have in recent times.\"New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer, recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range.That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years.Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch.The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test, all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004.\"I'm looking forward to these two test matches,\" McCullum said. \"It will be a great series, two evenly matched teams.\"Not a better way to go out really.\"   \n",

But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.    \n",

When I was his coach he was an outstanding talent.That talent doesnt go away but it depends on how much you are motivated and how much you still want to do well.It wouldnt surprise me if Butt made a successful international comeback, Pakpassion.net quoted him as saying.Speaking about Muhammad Amir Lawson said he remembers Amir asa very young player who came to some of my practice sessions when I was coaching Pakistan.Amir was working with the Under 19s and even then looked very impressive.I am pleased that after a difficult period he has comeback bigger and stronger and is bowling terrifically well. It is also very good for Pakistan cricket that he is back he said.Talking about the attitude of some Pakistani players that has come into question after comments from some coaches Lawson said if people are not willing to work hard then there are enough good young players in Pakistan to replace them.Get people in who are motivated. If you arent playing for your country then there is no point in playing cricket.Pakistan has had some pretty successful times lately under Waqar Younis and Misbah ul Haq and one would hope that the players would continue to be motivated, he said.Commenting on the Day Night Test cricket he said he is surprised at the resistance of some countries.Well done to Pakistan in agreeing to play a Day Night Test match in Australia.The pink ball is not that different to a red ball in any case you just have to practice with it and its fine.We use red or white so why not use pink cricket balls Pakistan should be congratulated on agreeing to play in Australia with the pink ball he said.   \n",

       "2279  strong>ANTIGUA:  India´s test ranking has long been based on their formidable home form but the side aim to impress new coach Anil Kumble by showing they can adapt to conditions outside the subcontinent in a four-test against West Indies starting in Antigua on Thursday.</strongFor the hosts, however, the task is more straightforward -- simply proving they can still be competitive in the long form of the game.Since last touring West Indies in 2011, when they ground out a 1-0 test series victory (with two draws), India have lost six consecutive series outside of Asia - two each in England and Australia and one each in South Africa and New Zealand.Their record in that time is one win, 15 defeats and five draws.That does not include a 2-1 series victory in nearby Sri Lanka last year, where conditions are typically similar to those encountered at home.Former leg-spinner Kumble was recently appointed head coach of the Indians, who are second behind Australia in the test rankings, after pitching a plan to fix that miserable away record.And while he has already moved to tighten discipline, introducing a fine of $50 for being late, he shies away from being branded a strict disciplinarian.\"All I know I am a cricket coach and whether I am strict or lenient, you will probably have to ask the team,\" he said recently.Kumble could hardly ask for a better chance to start the job on a winning note than against a West Indies team weakened by administrative conflict and the unavailability of several key players, with fast bowler Jerome Taylor the latest to retire from the test format.While West Indies excel in the Twenty20 format, they are eighth of nine nations in the test rankings, ahead only of minnows Bangladesh.Kumble has stressed his team must demonstrate patience throughout the series, a sentiment shared by West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.\"We expect to face a lot of spin against the Indians in this series, so it is about playing the waiting game,\" said Brathwaite, who blasted four sixes in a row against England to seal West Indies´ World Twenty20 triumph in April.\"We need to look to spend long periods at the crease so we are preaching that in the dressing room.\"After the first test in Antigua, the remaining tests will be played in Jamaica (July 30- Aug. 3), St Lucia (Aug. 9-13) and Trinidad (Aug. 18-22).strong>SQUADS:</strongstrong>West Indies:</strong> Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Carlos Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Rajendra Chandrika, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Leon Johnson, Marlon SamuelsIndia.strong>India:</strong> Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Stuart Binny, Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Cheteshwar Pujara, Lokesh Rahul, Wriddhiman Saha, Rohit Sharma, Shardul Thakur, Murali Vijay, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma.   \n",

In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal.

He remained the 'King of Swing' throughout his 19 year long career.In his cricketing career that spanned over almost two decades Wasim has taken a whooping 916 international wickets and to date continues to be an inspiration to aspiring cricketers.Wasim, considered to be the most prolific Pakistani fast bowler to have ever played the game, picked up an impressive 414 wickets in 104 test matches while in ODIs, he has notched up 502 wickets in the 356 matches that he played for Pakistan. At blistering pace, Wasim Akram's reverse swing deliveries bamboozled batsmen around the world and made him one of the most respected cricketers of all time. He also has the honour of being part of the 1992 World Cup-winning Pakistan cricket team, led by Imran Khan. Akram's three wickets in the final helped Pakistan clinch the match and the world cup. Wasim Akram captained Pakistan briefly after Imran Khan and Javed Miandad retired and led his side to the world cup final in 1999 but since then, match-fixing allegations and complications got in the way of his captaining the side ever again. He retired after the 2003 World Cup, when he was dropped from the national squad after Pakistan's dismal performance. Wasim has also been appointed as the bowling coach of the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders and frequently commentates as well. Wasim married Australian Shaniera Thompson in 2013 and has a daughter from her named Aiyla. He will always be included among not only the greatest cricketers to have emerged from Pakistan, but the world over.    \n",

    "\n",
    "Cosine Similarity could consider Synonyms using a synonym libary (e.g., Gensim). This improvement could be implemented by iterating through the tokens of the input text and appending any synonyms (or top synonyms) of these tokens to the end of the input text. Although not perfect, this approach would allow the cosine similarity ranking to take into account synonyms within the similarity search query.\n",

    "\n",
    "Supervised ML based methods could be used to develop a  recommendation like system where using a classification model (e.g., SVM) could be used to identify similar records. Unsupervised ML based methods: could use a clustering algorithm to find cluster of similar records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other methods such as those that use word embeddings, sentence embeddings, sentence transformers, large language models (e.g., word2Vec, BERT, T5, LLMs, huggingface models, etc.) may provide better outputs after fine-tuning for the required task (sentiment analysis, summarization, classification, text/image generation, question answering, etc.). However, the computational\n",
    "Other non-traditional approaches may include combining approaches. For example, one may first run clustering algorithm to limit the amount of data and then use a similarity calculation. However, these combined methods would need to be benchmarked to compare performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a NLP application, user options can be provided that either provide use of different models and changing parameters or preset options that change parameters. For example, some Generative-AI LLM based tools have provided users with options such as \"creative\" \"balanced\" or \"precise\". Presumably these options change the parameters that affect text generation."
