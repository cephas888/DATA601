    "The previous notebook discussed Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Bag of Words (BoW) model in more detail. Recall that NLP refers to the process and data transformation that a system and algorithms perform to understand, and extract meaning and insights from unstructured data (e.g., text, language, etc.). In the case of BoW it converts text tokens (e.g., words, terms, phrases, sentences, etc.) into a matrix with their vector or numerical representation. The resulting vector matrix can then used for various tasks including but not limited classification, clustering, recommendation, ranking (e.g., based on similarity), question answering, text summarization, and generative (e.g., given a prompt generate text, image, sound, and video). Note that in large language model (LLM) space, some of these tasks are called fine-tunning. This notebook discusses the BoW model can be used for performing similarity ranking/searching tasks."

    "Similarity ranking refers to a technique of using cosine similarity metric to measure how similar one collection of text (e.g., sentence, paragraph, document) to another collection of text. Besides similarity ranking it may be called in various other ways such as similarity, similarity searching, document similarity, cosine similarity, among other. This section shows a simple example and then uses the health dataset from the previous notebook to perform an actual similarity search."

It later stood at $42.70, down $1.18 from Monday´s close.Nearing midday in London, European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for May delivery fell $1.14 to $52.80 a barrel.Crude futures also dropped Monday on worries over growing US oil inventories, which already stand at record-high levels adding to the global oversupply.In addition, the market fell sharply after OPEC questioned the strength of last month´s rally, saying in a report that the price increase came \"despite the fact that global supply continued to exceed demand\".Traders are now eagerly awaiting Wednesday´s weekly US government report on crude reserves for the week to March 13.\"Growing concerns that US crude stockpiles would see additional builds this week pushed prices lower,\" said Sucden analyst Kash Kamal.A Bloomberg News survey showed US crude stockpiles are expected to have increased by 3.3 million barrels to 452.2 million last week.US crude stockpiles have risen for nine weeks in a row to reach a record 448.9 million barrels on March 6.Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said the recent price decline was due to \"concerns that US crude supplies are at record levels and continue to build up\".World oil prices have collapsed by more than half since June last year on mounting US supplies, weak global economic growth and OPEC´s decision to keep output high despite falling prices.Leading US energy producers have curtailed some investment, resulting in lower weekly rig counts.Despite the reduced drilling, Goldman Sachs estimated Monday that US output would still grow by 230,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with a year ago.

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things.

       "      <td>strong&gt;MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.&lt;/strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong&gt;FAILED EXPERIMENTS&lt;/strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON: Pakistan off-spin great Saqlain Mushtaq is set for another spell as an England coaching consultant, highlighting how fluid national allegiances can become when a cricketer´s playing days are over.Saqlain was brought in by England ahead of the recent second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford.In the build-up he found himself working with both off-spinner Moeen Ali and leg-break bowler Adil Rashid, although only Ali of the pair made it into the XI that won by 330 runs with more than a day to spare to level the four-match series at 1-1.Saqlain´s former Pakistan team-mate Mushtaq Ahmed, is carrying out a similar role with the tourists in more of a permanent capacity.Prior to taking up his Pakistan role, former leg-spinner Mushtaq was England´s spin-bowling coach.Off-spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan, Test cricket´s all-time leading wicket-taker, has come under fire for working with Australia in their ongoing series in his native Sri Lanka.By contrast the atmosphere between English and Pakistani officials has been far more cordial.That´s partly because, as this is Pakistan´s first tour of England since their infamous 2010 spot-fixing debacle at Lord´s, both sides are desperate to let their cricket do the talking.It is also a reflection of their multi-national backroom staffs, with England head coach Trevor Bayliss an Australian and his Pakistan counterpart, Mickey Arthur, a South African.Added to all that, Pakistan fielding coach Steve Rixon, the former Australia wicket-keeper, and Bayliss -- who made his name internationally as Sri Lanka coach -- were once team-mates in the same New South Wales side.</td>\n",

       "      <td>PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka: Australian captain Steve Smith named spin twins Nathan Lyon and Steve O´Keefe in his line-up Monday for the series opener against Sri Lanka as the newly-crowned kings of Test cricket look to cement their supremacy.On the day that Australia were presented with the mace as the world number one side, Smith took the unusual move of naming his starting XI a day before the start of the first Test in Pallekele, near Kandy.Australia´s rise up the rankings has been based in large part on the performance of their fast bowlers such as Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and they rarely field more than one spinner.But after taking 10 wickets in a warm-up last week, O´Keefe has been picked to play only his third Test alongside the more experienced Nathan Lyon -- his close friend and Sheffield Shield teammate.\"Both our spinners bowled well in the practice game. They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. It´s going to be exciting,\" Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lanka´s reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lanka´s premier spinner Rangana Herath.\"The wicket will take spin for sure here. Not sure about the first innings, but it looks very dry and lots of cracks on it. It certainly will help spin bowlers,\" Smith added.\"They (Sri Lanka) have some quality spinners in their rank led by Rangana Herath. He has done really well in these conditions. The batters need to have some good plans against him at what he is going to bring at us.\"Smith confirmed that vice-captain David Warner will play after being sidelined for six weeks with a broken left index finger.Mathews held back from naming his starting XI and was instead cursing a new round of injury woes to an already depleted squad.Fast bowler Suranga Lakmal complained of a stiff hamstring after training on Sunday before the uncapped Dhananjaya de Silva hurt his finger during fielding drills, Mathews revealed.Australia XI: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Joe Burns, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill, Steve O´Keeffe, Mitchell Starc, Adam VogesSri Lanka squad: Angelo Mathews (captain), Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Janith Perera, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Suranga Lakmal</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;NAGPUR: New Zealand are bracing for a trial by spin when they open their World Twenty20 campaign against hosts India on Tuesday, skipper Kane Williamson said on the eve of their Super 10 fixture.&lt;/strongThe Indian team have been widely touted as firm favourites to win the biennial event due to their knowledge about the conditions at home and a strong run of form in the buildup to the tournament.New Zealand, though, have defeated India in all their previous four meetings in the shortest format of the game but their progress was somewhat thwarted against England's spinners on Saturday in their warm-up match.\"We certainly are expecting spin to pay a big part in this tournament,\" Williamson told reporters on Monday, adding their past record against India would have no bearing on the match.\"I suppose judging by the warm-up games in Mumbai, they had a bit for the seamers and it swung a little bit.\"They were very good surfaces but from what cricket we have seen here in Nagpur, spin looks likely to play a big part. It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly.\"Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part-timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in.New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai, having played a two-test home series against Australia, during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket.Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20-over format.\"We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate. India is a strong side and Twenty20 cricket is fickle in nature,\" Williamson said.India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in bilateral series before winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, a run that saw them win 10 of their last 11 T20 matches.Batting stalwart Virat Kohli was confident the team can handle the burden of expectations.\"At home we expect that, we're prepared for that,\" Kohli said. \"The skill required is how you manage yourself off the field, because on the field is probably the safest and quietest for you, especially in your home country.\"The field is where you face the least pressure in big tournaments like this.\"We're taking some good momentum into the World Cup. The Asia Cup was a good preparation for us, getting a feel of playing against big teams. This is far more challenging, with teams from all over the world.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;JAMAICA: West Indies have added 19-year-old fast bowler Alzarri Joseph to their squad for the second test against India starting in Jamaica on Saturday.&lt;/strongJoseph brings genuine pace to a West Indies attack that struggled for penetration in a lopsided innings and 92-run defeat in the first test in Antigua last week.The Antiguan teenager earned selection after impressing in the under-19 World Cup won by West Indies in February. He bowled the fastest delivery of the tournament, clocked at 143 kilometres per hour.Joseph has played just eight first class matches, picking up 24 wickets at an average of a tad over 24.West Indies veteran Marlon Samuels described Joseph as young, fit, fast and fearless and chairman of selectors Courtney Browne thought the youngster was ready for promotion.\"We feel that Alzarri ",
       " will now benefit from the professional guidance of our coaching staff and the presence of fast bowling legend Joel Garner as manager,\" Browne said.Josephs addition brings the squad to 14 players, with nobody dropped after the first test, where India piled up 566 for eight declared.Shannon Gabriel was the only genuine quick in that line-up, backed by fast-medium exponents Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite.Early reports suggest the pitch at Sabina Park in Kingston may be green and give the fast bowlers some assistance in the second of the four tests in the series.West Indies also underperformed with the bat in the first test, compiling scores of only 243 and 231.Samuels, who scored one and 50, says it is time he raised his test batting to the level of his performances in Twenty20 and One Day Internationals.He averages only 33.39 in test matches, less than his ODI average and not far shy of his Twenty20 average.I havent been getting the runs Ive been looking for in the test arena but Ive been making up in the shorter version, the 35-year-old said.Its up to me to focus more and (put) in some big performance so the team can benefit.He said he felt a lot of pressure and was aware he needed to temper his aggression at times and focus on occupying the crease.Im batting at four, so I have to dominate. The responsibility is great so I have to change my game.</td>\n",

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things. I would be more than happy to help them get better in their skill not just from the bowling perspective but batting and fielding as well, Azhar added.   \n",

       "1827  strong>MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.</strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.   \n",

They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. It´s going to be exciting,\" Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lanka´s reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lanka´s premier spinner Rangana Herath.\"The wicket will take spin for sure here. Not sure about the first innings, but it looks very dry and lots of cracks on it. It certainly will help spin bowlers,\" Smith added.\"They (Sri Lanka) have some quality spinners in their rank led by Rangana Herath. He has done really well in these conditions. The batters need to have some good plans against him at what he is going to bring at us.\"Smith confirmed that vice-captain David Warner will play after being sidelined for six weeks with a broken left index finger.Mathews held back from naming his starting XI and was instead cursing a new round of injury woes to an already depleted squad.Fast bowler Suranga Lakmal complained of a stiff hamstring after training on Sunday before the uncapped Dhananjaya de Silva hurt his finger during fielding drills, Mathews revealed.Australia XI: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner, Joe Burns, Josh Hazlewood, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill, Steve O´Keeffe, Mitchell Starc, Adam VogesSri Lanka squad: Angelo Mathews (captain), Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Janith Perera, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Roshen Silva, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Sandakan, Suranga Lakmal       \n",

It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly.\"Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part-timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in.New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai, having played a two-test home series against Australia, during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket.Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20-over format.\"We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate. India is a strong side and Twenty20 cricket is fickle in nature,\" Williamson said.India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in bilateral series before winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, a run that saw them win 10 of their last 11 T20 matches.Batting stalwart Virat Kohli was confident the team can handle the burden of expectations.\"At home we expect that, we're prepared for that,\" Kohli said. \"The skill required is how you manage yourself off the field, because on the field is probably the safest and quietest for you, especially in your home country.\"The field is where you face the least pressure in big tournaments like this.\"We're taking some good momentum into the World Cup. The Asia Cup was a good preparation for us, getting a feel of playing against big teams. This is far more challenging, with teams from all over the world.\"   \n",

He bowled the fastest delivery of the tournament, clocked at 143 kilometres per hour.Joseph has played just eight first class matches, picking up 24 wickets at an average of a tad over 24.West Indies veteran Marlon Samuels described Joseph as young, fit, fast and fearless and chairman of selectors Courtney Browne thought the youngster was ready for promotion.\"We feel that Alzarri \n",
       " will now benefit from the professional guidance of our coaching staff and the presence of fast bowling legend Joel Garner as manager,\" Browne said.Josephs addition brings the squad to 14 players, with nobody dropped after the first test, where India piled up 566 for eight declared.Shannon Gabriel was the only genuine quick in that line-up, backed by fast-medium exponents Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite.Early reports suggest the pitch at Sabina Park in Kingston may be green and give the fast bowlers some assistance in the second of the four tests in the series.West Indies also underperformed with the bat in the first test, compiling scores of only 243 and 231.Samuels, who scored one and 50, says it is time he raised his test batting to the level of his performances in Twenty20 and One Day Internationals.He averages only 33.39 in test matches, less than his ODI average and not far shy of his Twenty20 average.I havent been getting the runs Ive been looking for in the test arena but Ive been making up in the shorter version, the 35-year-old said.Its up to me to focus more and (put) in some big performance so the team can benefit.He said he felt a lot of pressure and was aware he needed to temper his aggression at times and focus on occupying the crease.Im batting at four, so I have to dominate. The responsibility is great so I have to change my game.   \n",

    "Before running a similarity search, some form of data cleaning, preparation, and/or transofrmation may need to be performed (whcih is not shown in this notebook). Once the data is cleaned and loaded, there are six general steps that occur in the above example and functions whe performing a similarity ranking against a search query. The following steps are teh general steps performed in the previos NLP BoW model notebook and the functions input_bow_cos_calc() and rank_DATA() above. The steps are as follows:\n",

    "1. Target text data that will be used for ranking is normalized (e.g., lemmatized and/or stemmed).\n",
    "2. Input Text is submitted and cleaned using the same normalization as the target text.\n",
    "3. Target Text is vectorized (i.e., bag of words matrix with TFIDF scores).\n",
    "4. Input text is vectorized using the same method as the target text.\n",
    "5. Calculation of similarity between the vectors (i.e., token dimensions) using a similarity metric (e.g., cosine).\n",
    "6. Display the ranked data or the target output. The target output may vary depending on what the system is used for. For example we may only need the ranking of the top 10 records. Another example, in a Q&A system a the similarity between an input query and the text in the database but the output may only need to be the answer pair for the top ranked results.\n",

       "      <td>HONG KONG: Asian markets started 2015 on an upswing in limited trading on Friday, with mainland Chinese stocks surging in Hong Kong on speculation Beijing may ease monetary policy to boost slowing growth.Hong Kong rose 1.07 percent, closing 252.78 points higher at 23857.82.Seoul closed up 0.57 percent, rising 10.85 points to 1,926.44, while Sydney gained 0.46 percent, or 24.89 points, to close at 5,435.9.Singapore edged up 0.19 percent, gaining 6.39 points to 3,371.54.Markets in mainland China, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Thailand remained closed for holidays.With mainland bourses shut until January 5, shares in Chinese developers and financial companies surged in Hong Kong, stoked by hopes that Beijing could ease monetary policy to support lagging growth in the world´s second-largest economy.China Vanke, the country´s biggest developer by sales, leapt 10.8 percent and the People´s Insurance Company (Group) of China Ltd. was up 5.51 percent in afternoon trading.Train-builders CSR Corp. and China CNR Corp. soared -- CSR by 16.5 percent and China CNR by 16.0 percent -- extending gains on December 31 after they announced a merger agreement.China´s manufacturing growth dropped in December to its lowest level of 2014, an official survey showed Thursday, as the sector struggles with weak domestic demand.China´s official Purchasing Managers´ Index (PMI) released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) came in at 50.1 last month, down from 50.3 recorded in November.The index, which tracks activity in factories and workshops, is considered a key indicator of the health of China´s economy, a major driver of global growth. A figure above 50 signals expansion, while anything below indicates contraction.\"Growth momentum is still insufficient,\" NBS said in a statement. - Investors eye US factory data -On forex markets the dollar extended gains ahead of the release of American factory data due later on Friday and following a steady stream of good news from the world´s biggest economy.The dollar bought 120.44 yen, compared to 119.44 yen in final 2014 trading on Wednesday.Wall Street toasted a banner year in 2014, with US equity markets finishing near all-time highs.The euro meanwhile slipped amid growing expectations that the European Central Bank, which meets on January 22, will start buying sovereign bonds. The single currency bought $1.2061 compared to $1.2160 in pre-holiday trade.The ECB has already used several tools to push inflation in member nations back up to the 2.0 percent annual rate it regards as healthy, including asset purchases and making cheap loans available to banks.It is also examining the possibility of large-scale purchases of sovereign debt -- so-called quantitative easing (QE) -- to help jump-start the European Union´s moribund economy.Oil prices rose on Friday, with US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rising 44 cents to $54.07 and Brent crude for February gaining 18 cents to $57.51.\"The gains in Asian trading are likely because of the positive US crude stockpiles data released on Wednesday,\" Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore, told AFP.US crude reserves fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week to December 26, the US Energy Information Administration said in its last petroleum report for 2014 released on Wednesday, boosting prices that lost nearly half their value in the second half of the year.There is growing speculation that the slide in global oil prices -- the biggest since the financial crisis in 2008 -- may have been excessive.\"If we do see some supply-side responses, or even if they´re anticipated over the course of this first quarter of the year, we might find that oil has in fact bottomed,\" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg.Gold was at $1,182.36 an ounce, compared with $1,199.00 in end-of-year trading on Wednesday.In other markets:-- Jakarta ended up 0.30 percent, or 15.82 points, at 5,242.77.Coal firm Indo Tambangraya Megah gained 3.41 percent to 15,900 rupiah, while miner Aneka Tambang slipped 1.88 percent to 1,045 rupiah.-- Malaysia´s main stock index shed 0.48 percent, or 8.48 points, to close at 1,752.77.Malayan Banking lost 0.55 percent to 9.12 ringgit, Public Bank slipped 0.44 percent to 18.22 while Top Globe added 1.77 percent 4.60 ringgit.-- Singapore rose 0.16 percent, or 5.44 points, to 3,370.59.Agribusiness company Wilmar International gained 0.93 percent to Sg$3.27 while real estate developer Capitaland dipped 0.30 percent to Sg$3.30.-- Mumbai gained 1.38 percent, or 380.36 points, to end at 27,887.90.Housing Development Finance Corp rose 4.30 percent to 1,171.80 rupees, while Mahindra &amp; Mahindra fell 0.92 percent to 1,224.80 rupees.

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things.

       "      <td>strong&gt;MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.&lt;/strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong&gt;FAILED EXPERIMENTS&lt;/strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.</td>\n",

Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league. He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye. I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things. I would be more than happy to help them get better in their skill not just from the bowling perspective but batting and fielding as well, Azhar added.   \n",

       "1827  strong>MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.</strongThe 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.\"There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,\" Zampa told Australian media.\"The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.\"People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.\"strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.\"The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,\" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.   \n",

    "There are other approaches that may leverage supervised ML, unsupervised ML and deep learning. Below are some thoughts on some other approaches that could be explored, evaluated and compared for model performance and computational requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Similarity Search Improvement: Tokens of Input Search\n",
    "One of the disadvantages of cosine similarity is that for large dataframes (i.e., above 1 million records) and depending on the parameters of the vectorization used to calculate the BOW matrix, the computational requriements may be too high. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach that could reduce computational requirements in these cases is to first calculate the BOW matrix tokens (e.g., text, words, terms, phrases, sentences) using the input text and then fit the records text data to that BOW. This will greatly limit the amount of tokens used in the vectorization by removing tokens that are not of interest of the query. This may increase performance but potentially at the cost of lower accuracy as it will be removing many tokens from the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note in this approach the order of the creation of the BoW matrix changes and the function input_bow_cos_calc_2 has been modified to take this change into account. In this case the BoW matrix is generated using the words and tokens of those words found in the input text query rather than on the full text of the dataframe. The dataframe vectors are then calculated only on the words of the input text. This results in a much smaller BoW matrix. The rest of the process and functions are exactly the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one significant difference is that, for those articles that have words in the query, the resulting cosine score tends to be much higher. This is because the calculation of TFIDF values considers the total number of words within an article. For example, the term frequency is calculated by the division of how many times the term appears in the narrative divided by total number of terms. Total number of terms is determined by those terms modeled in the matrix and not all actual words. In this approach, since the total number of words is significantly reduced by only using the words of the query input text the TFIDF vectors results in much larger numbers. Using the other approach, penalizes or suppreses long articles while this approach may tends to ignore lenght of the article. "

       "      <td>PRETORIA:  South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada took a career-best 6-101 to leave England on 318 for eight wickets at tea and trailing by 157 runs on the third day of the fourth and final Test at Centurion Park on Sunday.Rabada had decimated the England middle-order before lunch, claiming the big wicket of Ben Stokes (33) during a rain-hit middle session, with the visitors reeling after the Proteas posted 475 in their first innings.Moeen Ali (45 not out) provided a steady hand in response and along with Stuart Broad (four not out) will look to close the gap on a wicket that was starting to favour the bowlers.England have already wrapped up the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead.Stokes looked at his fluent best before he was caught at slip by Hashim Amla shortly after South Africa, who posted a first innings total of 475, had taken the new ball.Chris Woakes (26) was the only other wicket to fall in the session and could count himself unlucky, an edge off the part-time spin of JP Duminy hitting the thigh of wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock and looping to Dean Elgar at slip.Rabada had removed Joe Root (76), James Taylor (14) and Jonny Bairstow (0) in quick succession in the minutes before lunch.Root had looked set for a big score but was caught by De Kock having a drive at Rabada after he had brought up his fourth half-century of the series.Taylor fell to the same combination trying to pull a short ball, before Bairstow got a feather edge through to De Kock.Rabada is just the second player in history to take six wickets in an innings in both tests and One-Day Internationals before the age of 21, joining Pakistan great Waqar Younis on that short list.Captain Alastair Cook (76) was the first wicket to fall on day three when he was caught behind by De Kock off the bowling of fast bowler Morne Morkel.Coming around the wicket to the left-hander, Morkel angled the ball into Cook´s body and induced an edge as it moved away slightly off the wicket.It left Cook still 41 runs shy of becoming the first England batsman to reach 10,000 test runs after he had put on 99 for the third wicket with Root.

       "      <td>strong&gt;Pakistan did all they could to get their World Twenty20 match against India moved to Kolkata, even threatening to withdraw, but poor selection and the hosts´ all-round superiority left them wishing they had not bothered to turn up at all.&lt;/strongThe most anticipated match of the tournament between the neighbours was shifted to Eden Gardens at the last moment over security concerns at the original venue at Dharamsala.Pakistan repeatedly emphasised India´s morale-sapping loss in the opener against New Zealand was an advantage for them and they were even more confident of breaking their jinx of losing every World Cup match between the bitter rivals.Their decision to play four fast bowlers against India reflected an approach more suited to the 1980s West Indies side and dropping spinner Imad Wasim at the expense of a paceman underlined their failure to read the surface.Asked to bat in the rain-shortened Group Two match, the 2009 champions were largely subdued once off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got the new ball to turn viciously.Doubts seemed to creep into Pakistan´s minds regarding what would be a decent target to set India, who folded for 79 against the Kiwis on a turning track while chasing 127 in their opener, and the innings never gained momentum until the death overs.MEAGRE TOTAL\"There are few areas we need to improve, specially our batting,\" said Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with a 26 for Pakistan.\"Even though it was a tough pitch to bat on, I believe we could have set a higher target.\"In the end, Pakistan could only manage a meagre 118 for five in their 18 overs, nowhere near enough without the bowling depth New Zealand could draw upon in Nagpur when their spinners picked up nine of 10 wickets to stun India.India did suffer a minor wobble though, slumping to 23-3 after Mohammad Sami dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive deliveries in the fifth over to silence the 60,000 crowd at Eden Gardens as well as the millions watching on TV.However, India´s batting mainstay Virat Kohli hit a prudent 55 not out to calm the nerves and showed why he is considered one of the world´s best.The right-hander, who averages almost 85 in T20s against Pakistan, was aided by the fact that he did not have to face too many deliveries from Mohammad Amir, whose opening spell of 1-3 ran shivers down India´s spines.The left-arm paceman was not brought back on by Shahid Afridi until India were nearing victory and the leg-spinning skipper, who lacks the guile to turn the ball effectively, was unable to stem the flow of runs himself.As the pressure lifted, India were easily able to maintain their utter dominance of Pakistan in World Cup events, adding a fifth World Twenty20 victory to the six triumphs in the 50-over format.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MELBOURNE: Australia´s cricket board will make it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Test batsman Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers and players fielding close to the wicket will also have to wear helmets in first class matches in accordance with the David Curtain review, which was released on Wednesday.The helmets, mandatory in games and during practice, must adhere to the highest British standard, Cricket Australia (CA) said.Hughes was struck on the back of the head by a rising delivery when batting for South Australia in a domestic match in November 2014.He died two days later in a Sydney hospital aged 25.\"There´s not a day that goes by where we don´t think of Phillip,\" CA boss James Sutherland told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.\"This report won´t bring him back and it won´t do anything to ease the pain of his family or his loved ones who miss him most.\"But we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\"Hughes´s death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who face fast bowling that can exceed 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).Hughes was wearing an Australian standard helmet when he was struck but the Curtain report said even the newer British standard helmet available at the time would not have afforded him extra protection from the blow.The report also said an apparent delay in the arrival of the ambulance team that treated Hughes played no part in his death.\"I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,\" it said.The report also recommended wicketkeepers play with protective eye-wear but stopped short of endorsing the clip-on neck guards on the back of helmets, which some players have worn after Hughes´s death.Sutherland said CA still encouraged players to wear the guards but conceded, like the report, that more research was required to determine whether they actually increased safety.\"We´re certainly taking up the running on that to make sure we understand it better,\" he said.Sutherland said the board had also sought approval from the International Cricket Council to trial the use of injury substitutes who could bat and bowl in domestic games.Substitutes have been permitted to replace injured or ill players in matches for over 100 years but are not allowed to bat, bowl or act as wicketkeepers or captains, according to the laws of the game.Initially the substitutes would replace players ruled out by concussion but in future their use could be expanded to include other forms of injury, Sutherland added.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MOHALI: Not even the support of a festive home crowd and conditions they thrive could inspire India Women as they slumped to a three-run loss to West Indies Women in Mohali.The defeat brought the curtains down on India's disappointing World Twenty20 campaign.Jhulan Goswami, who bowled all of two overs on a slow surface, kept India alive with a few lusty blows that brought the equation down to 20 off the last two overs.Tension engulfed the PCA Stadium, but a crowd that was on tenterhooks roared in delight as the third ball of the penultimate over sailed over long-on to bring it down to 12 off nine balls.But her run-out off the next delivery, once again, meant the pendulum swung West Indies' way. Deandra Dottin, who ensured West Indies were in with a chance by making 45 off 40 balls in the team's total of 114 for 8, then showed immaculate death-bowling skills to leave India short-changed.Shikha Pandey, who carved a boundary over point to bring it down to five off three balls was run-out off the next delivery to effectively dash India's hopes.India landed the early punches and weakened West Indies to 26 for 3 as the contest was reduced to a battle of spin attacks.The hosts then switched off for a bit, only to see Stafanie Taylor and Dottin regain lost ground, and then lift West Indies with a fourth-wicket partnership of 77.The stand helped West Indies post a total of 114 for 8, challenging, but by no means impossible.</td>\n",

       "1480                          strong>Pakistan did all they could to get their World Twenty20 match against India moved to Kolkata, even threatening to withdraw, but poor selection and the hosts´ all-round superiority left them wishing they had not bothered to turn up at all.</strongThe most anticipated match of the tournament between the neighbours was shifted to Eden Gardens at the last moment over security concerns at the original venue at Dharamsala.Pakistan repeatedly emphasised India´s morale-sapping loss in the opener against New Zealand was an advantage for them and they were even more confident of breaking their jinx of losing every World Cup match between the bitter rivals.Their decision to play four fast bowlers against India reflected an approach more suited to the 1980s West Indies side and dropping spinner Imad Wasim at the expense of a paceman underlined their failure to read the surface.Asked to bat in the rain-shortened Group Two match, the 2009 champions were largely subdued once off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got the new ball to turn viciously.Doubts seemed to creep into Pakistan´s minds regarding what would be a decent target to set India, who folded for 79 against the Kiwis on a turning track while chasing 127 in their opener, and the innings never gained momentum until the death overs.MEAGRE TOTAL\"There are few areas we need to improve, specially our batting,\" said Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with a 26 for Pakistan.\"Even though it was a tough pitch to bat on, I believe we could have set a higher target.\"In the end, Pakistan could only manage a meagre 118 for five in their 18 overs, nowhere near enough without the bowling depth New Zealand could draw upon in Nagpur when their spinners picked up nine of 10 wickets to stun India.India did suffer a minor wobble though, slumping to 23-3 after Mohammad Sami dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive deliveries in the fifth over to silence the 60,000 crowd at Eden Gardens as well as the millions watching on TV.However, India´s batting mainstay Virat Kohli hit a prudent 55 not out to calm the nerves and showed why he is considered one of the world´s best.The right-hander, who averages almost 85 in T20s against Pakistan, was aided by the fact that he did not have to face too many deliveries from Mohammad Amir, whose opening spell of 1-3 ran shivers down India´s spines.The left-arm paceman was not brought back on by Shahid Afridi until India were nearing victory and the leg-spinning skipper, who lacks the guile to turn the ball effectively, was unable to stem the flow of runs himself.As the pressure lifted, India were easily able to maintain their utter dominance of Pakistan in World Cup events, adding a fifth World Twenty20 victory to the six triumphs in the 50-over format.   \n",

       "1726  MELBOURNE: Australia´s cricket board will make it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Test batsman Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers and players fielding close to the wicket will also have to wear helmets in first class matches in accordance with the David Curtain review, which was released on Wednesday.The helmets, mandatory in games and during practice, must adhere to the highest British standard, Cricket Australia (CA) said.Hughes was struck on the back of the head by a rising delivery when batting for South Australia in a domestic match in November 2014.He died two days later in a Sydney hospital aged 25.\"There´s not a day that goes by where we don´t think of Phillip,\" CA boss James Sutherland told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.\"This report won´t bring him back and it won´t do anything to ease the pain of his family or his loved ones who miss him most.\"But we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\"Hughes´s death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who face fast bowling that can exceed 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).Hughes was wearing an Australian standard helmet when he was struck but the Curtain report said even the newer British standard helmet available at the time would not have afforded him extra protection from the blow.The report also said an apparent delay in the arrival of the ambulance team that treated Hughes played no part in his death.\"I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,\" it said.The report also recommended wicketkeepers play with protective eye-wear but stopped short of endorsing the clip-on neck guards on the back of helmets, which some players have worn after Hughes´s death.Sutherland said CA still encouraged players to wear the guards but conceded, like the report, that more research was required to determine whether they actually increased safety.\"We´re certainly taking up the running on that to make sure we understand it better,\" he said.Sutherland said the board had also sought approval from the International Cricket Council to trial the use of injury substitutes who could bat and bowl in domestic games.Substitutes have been permitted to replace injured or ill players in matches for over 100 years but are not allowed to bat, bowl or act as wicketkeepers or captains, according to the laws of the game.Initially the substitutes would replace players ruled out by concussion but in future their use could be expanded to include other forms of injury, Sutherland added.   \n",

He removed star West Indian batsman Chris Gayle in the first over. Gayle was caught by Englands James Vince for six with a four.Qalandar lost their second wicket on 37 when captain Azhar Ali was bowled by Shakib Al-Hasanfor 18. Later, Cameron Delport was run out on 17 when Qalandars were 54 in 9.4 overs.Then, Imad Waseem got rid off of Sohaib Maqsood, who made 22 off 27 balls, and Qalandars were 80 for four in 14 overs.In the 19th over, Amir played havoc with the ball dismissing Dwayne Bravo on the 2nd, Zohaib Khan on the 3rd and Kiwon Kooper on the 4th ball to become the first bowler in the PSL to claim a hat-trick.Sohail Tanveer got the Qalandars eighth wicket in the final over of the innings when he clean bowled Mohammad Rizwan, who hit 37 off 31 balls.In the end, Shakib Al-Hasan was named the Player of the Match for his all round performance in the match.    \n",

Deandra Dottin, who ensured West Indies were in with a chance by making 45 off 40 balls in the team's total of 114 for 8, then showed immaculate death-bowling skills to leave India short-changed.Shikha Pandey, who carved a boundary over point to bring it down to five off three balls was run-out off the next delivery to effectively dash India's hopes.India landed the early punches and weakened West Indies to 26 for 3 as the contest was reduced to a battle of spin attacks.The hosts then switched off for a bit, only to see Stafanie Taylor and Dottin regain lost ground, and then lift West Indies with a fourth-wicket partnership of 77.The stand helped West Indies post a total of 114 for 8, challenging, but by no means impossible.    \n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;MUMBAI: Cricket pitches need to be more bowler-friendly if the rising imbalance between bat and ball is to be addressed, Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar has said.&lt;/strongThe Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) world cricket committee on Tuesday recommended limitations on the thickness and depth of bats amid concerns that the sport has tilted heavily in favour of the batsmen in recent years.A report commissioned by the MCC, the guardian of the game's laws, in 2014 found the thickness of bats had marginally increased in the last century and that edges had broadened by 300 percent, meaning even mistimed shots could still find the boundary.Tendulkar, who quit international cricket in 2013 as the game's most prolific batsman both in tests and the 50-over format, demanded more assistance for the bowlers from the playing surface.\"The wickets need to change; they need to be more helpful for bowlers,\" Tendulkar said.\"In T20s, the greatest of bowlers are being reverse-swept. Three-hundred is no longer competitive in ODIs.\"So there should be at least one format where bowlers have a better chance of executing their skills and making it more interesting for spectators.\"I don't think it's got much to do with bats, but I'm sure people on the (relevant) panel will be able to look into it.\"Tendulkar's views echoed the sentiments of Australian opener David Warner who said last week that flat pitches rather than bats with thicker edges are the reason batsmen have the upper hand in test cricket.Tendulkar was part of the panel that recommended Anil Kumble for the India coach's job and he expects the team to benefit from the vast experience of the former leg-spinner.\"A fabulous player, a hard competitor and will not make any compromises on the field,\" Tendulkar told ESPNcricinfo.\"He will be out there to win each and every moment.\"He played for almost 20 years, so there is plenty to share. I'll just tell the players to grasp as much information from Anil as possible.\"Kumble, who came out to bowl with a bandaged jaw in a 2002 Antigua test, can also teach the players how to handle adversity, said Tendulkar.\"There are always big, crunch moments in any match and how to approach those moments is important,\" Tendulkar said.\"In sport, over a period of time what you learn is not every day you are successful, sometimes you have to face failures.\"It is all about being a tough character and be able to stand back on your feet again and to compete the next day. Every day is a fresh day, new beginning. That is something I feel Anil will teach them.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;STOCKHOLM: The World Bank´s new chief economist is among those tipped to win the Nobel Economics Prize on Monday, as the awards season moves into a second week.&lt;/strongThe economics prize is unique among the Nobel awards in that it was created by the Swedish central bank in 1968 -- the others were all set up through the 1895 will of Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.This year, economists working on growth and labour markets are among those vying for the prize, which will be announced on Monday at 11:45 am (0945 GMT).The committee has a tendency to honour pairs or trios of economists, although last year a single laureate, US-British researcher Angus Deaton, was chosen for his groundbreaking work on poverty.Paul Romer -- the US academic, activist and entrepreneur who was appointed chief economist of the World Bank in July -- is favourite to win, according to Sweden´s Dagens Nyheterm newspaper, for his pioneering work on endogenous growth theory.This relatively new area of research tries to incorporate the way that people innovate and develop technologies into models of economic growth.Romer´s employers are certainly rooting for him: last week New York University´s Stern Business School, where he teaches, accidentally published a press release naming him as the winner and inviting journalists to a news conference.The school hastily withdrew the statement and apologised, saying it was merely preparing for a possible win and that it had been published accidentally. \"We are deeply sorry that these routine preparations may appear presumptuous,\" it said.Other names circulating include 94-year-old William Baumol of the US, a labour market specialist, and Indian-born US economist Jagdish Bhagwati, a free trade researcher.Bhagwati has played \"a large if subtle role in keeping protectionism from being respectable,\" according to the 2008 Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman.Of the 76 economics prize laureates, Americans dominate the list overwhelmingly, with 55 winners.If the Nobel committee were to look elsewhere this year, it could set its sights on France´s Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the IMF, or Swedish professor and ex-central banker Lars E.O. Svensson for his work on monetary policy./&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- ´Time for a woman´ -&lt;/strong Still more Americans have been named as possible winners: Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their work on financial panic models, or Robert Townsend for his work on risk and insurance in developing economies.Michael Woodford, a monetary theorist currently teaching at Columbia University, and Robert Barro, who researches the factors that determine economic growth, are also mentioned as serious candidates.Women remain largely absent from the list of economics laureates. Only one woman has won the prize -- Elinor Ostrom, in 2009.But French-American Esther Duflo, 43, would be an ideal laureate, according to economist Micael Dahlen, interviewed in Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.\"It´s high time for a woman to get the prize, for someone under the age of retirement to get it, and because her research is groundbreaking in the fields of poverty and economics, among other things,\" he said.The economics prize is the fifth of the six Nobel prizes to be announced this year.Last week, the awards for medicine, physics, and chemistry were announced, as well as the peace prize, which went to Colombia´s President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end a half-century war with the FARC rebels.The final prize, for literature, will be announced Thursday.For that award, the Swedish Academy could tap a superstar novelist such as Philip Roth of the US or Haruki Murakami of Japan, or a lesser-known writer such as Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse or Syrian poet Adonis.The Nobel prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and cheque for eight million Swedish kronor (828,000 euros, $928,000), which the laureates will receive at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10.</td>\n",

       "      <td>strong&gt;LAHORE: Pakistan's sporting decline has left the vast South Asian nation that once prided itself on producing the world's best hockey and squash players facing up to an Olympics for which none of its athletes have qualified.&lt;/strongWhile cricket remains a wildly popular game in Pakistan, a nation of almost 200 million people, most other sports have shrunk in popularity as the successes of the 1980s and early 1990s have become a distant memory.In dilapidated gyms and crumbling sports fields Pakistani athletes lament the dated equipment and obsolete training methods which leave them struggling against foreign foes who adhere to the latest science-based techniques.Female athletes have an even bigger mountain to climb: most young girls in the deeply conservative Muslim nation are pressured by their families to stop exercising in public, while those with family backing face the wrath of their communities.\"We are behind the rest of the world,\" said Inam Butt, a Pakistani wrestling champion who won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. \"Our budget, training and facilities are just nothing. How can we compete?\"Butt, like other athletes, says the future will remain bleak until Pakistan's government starts pouring money into sport.The seven participants due to represent Pakistan at next month's Rio Olympics have all been given wildcard entries and stand \"no chance\" of winning medals, according to Arif Hasan, the Pakistan Olympic Association president. \"They are more or less going for the participation and gaining the experience. Let's hope next time will be better,\" he said.strong&gt;1980s TRAINING METHODS&lt;/strong style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Those in charge of promoting sport in Pakistan despair.The grassroots system is almost non-existent, children in schools rarely play a sport which is not cricket, and top athletes seldom compete against the world's best as cash-strapped federations cannot afford to send them abroad. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Waqar Ahmed, deputy director of the Pakistan Sports Board, said federations also cannot afford to hire top coaches familiar with scientific training techniques and end up relying on Pakistani trainers with \"obsolete\" methods from the 1980s. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;\"Athletes are really frustrated because... the coaches are not literate and they have been teaching what they were taught 30 years back,\" he said. \"Without infrastructure we can do a lot, but without the techniques you cannot win.\" style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;The demise of hockey, Pakistan's national sport, has been painful to watch for an older generation who prospered during the halcyon days between 1960 and 1994, when Pakistan regularly won Olympic gold medals and world championships. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Tahir Zaman, Pakistan hockey team coach, said the lack of government support means many young athletes no longer see a future in sports like hockey where top players get $10 per day. Pakistani cricketers, by contrast, are paid $5,000 monthly retainers and make a fortune from sponsorship deals. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;\"The attraction is not there anymore. The (government) is not offering regular jobs for players,\" said Zaman, who won a bronze playing for Pakistan at the 1992 Olympics. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;At Lahore's empty 45,000-seat hockey stadium, Pakistani hockey player Hassan Anwar, 21, said that as a teenager his family begged him: \"please don't play hockey if you want a bright future\". style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;The demise of hockey has been mirrored by the decline in the Pakistani squash scene, where young players know all about 1980s legend Jahangir Khan - considered the greatest ever squash player - but none match his bravura on the court. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WOMEN HARASSED&lt;/strong style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Pakistan's best known squash player is Maria Toorpakay Wazir, ranked 65 in the world, but to train she spent years dressing and pretending to be a boy in the ultra-conservative tribal areas near Afghanistan. Now she trains abroad. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Pakistan Olympic chief Hasan says societal \"barriers are coming down\" for women but many female athletes rue the slow pace of change. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;At 16, Neelam Riaz's first love was cycling, but her father banned her from training on roads as men would stare at her. In response, she took up karate to learn how to fend off men and eventually stumbled on weightlifting. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;\"Usually in Pakistan girls are discouraged from sports, and often coaches push back,\" said Riaz, 25, who last year became a national champion and Pakistan's first female weightlifter to compete abroad. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;\"Now my family is happy with me doing weightlifting.\" style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;In a dimly lit Lahore gym, where paint peels off walls, windows are shattered and cobwebs cling to a damp ceiling, Riaz is tutoring 16-year-old Iqra Chanzaib, who is new to weightlifting. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;Chanzaib wanted to play basketball, but the only hoop near her house was out in the open and full of boys, so one of her pious brothers protested. She then opted for weightlifting, indoors. style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;\"There are plenty of girls like me but they cannot come because of family pressures. My own friends want to come but their families stop them,\" she said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>CAPE TOWN: South Africa recorded their first ever women's T20 victory over England to level the three-match series at 1-1. In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal. More rain followed and the players did not get back on but South Africa's batsmen had earned their first win over England after 14 attempts.</td>\n",

       "      <td>JOHANNESBURG: Sarah Taylor scored a third successive half-century and became the second player after Charlotte Edwards to score 2000 runs in the format as England sealed the three-match series against South Africa 2-1. Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare. Tammy Beaumont, who had been moved down from opening to the middle, played confidently to finish unbeaten on 21.</td>\n",

       "      <td>LONDON: Heather Knight had a dream first match as England women´s captain starring with both bat and ball in a seven-wicket win over Pakistan in Leicester on Tuesday.Knight, who replaced Charlotte Edwards after the long-serving batsman was effectively forced into retirement by England women´s coach Mark Robinson, took five for 26 with her off-spin and then struck an unbeaten 50 as her side cantered to victory with 18.1 overs to spare.It is the first time in 50-over international women's cricket that a player has scored a half-century and taken five wickets in the same match.Chasing 166 to win at the Fischer County Ground in a match originally scheduled for Monday but delayed because of a waterlogged outfield, England cantered home by seven wickets after Kent opener Tammy Beaumont made an international career-best score of 70.She was caught at mid-on in a miscued attempt to hit Asmavia Iqbal's medium pace over midwicket, her only real scare came when she was almost run out on 49, sent back by Knight after setting off for a single.Her partnership with Knight added 96 in 20 overs for the third wicket as England enjoyed the best batting conditions of the day. Nat Sciver then joined Knight, hitting 27 of the 37 more required at the fall of Beaumont's wicket but contriving to allow Knight to complete her half-century before securing the winning single off Iqbal.There was a nervous moment at the start of England's chase when opener Lauren Winfield was caught at slip off the first ball but though Pakistan's captain, the offspinner Sana Mir, bowled Georgia Elwiss for 12, at 53 for 2 from 10 overs England were already on target for a comfortable win.Pakistan´s 165 all out was built around opener Sidra Ameen´s 52 but none of her team-mates could offer much in the way of support with the bat.It was a day to remember, too, for strike bowler Katherine Brunt, who became only the fourth England player to take 100 ODI wickets.Pakistan's score was their highest in five one-day internationals against England but would have been regarded as disappointing given the platform provided by opener Sidras maiden ODI half-century.The 24-year-old right-hander from Lahore had made more than half her side's runs off the bat when she was fifth out at 106 in the 32nd over but support was lacking from Pakistan's top and middle order and had it not been for a late show of aggression from Sidra Nawaz and Iqbal then England's task would have been even more straightforward.Asked for bat first on a surface that was predictably sluggish after the wet weather that forced this match to be played in its entirety on the designated reserve day, Pakistan struggled to build early momentum.They crawled to 29 for 1 after 10 overs, the wicket that fell being the one that mattered in particular to Brunt, when Javeria Wadood, tempted by some width, edged the first ball of her fourth over and Amy Jones, keeping wicket for England for the first time in almost two-and-a-half years, held the catch.The result means England move into the top four places in the ICC Women's Championship. If they can maintain that position with eight matches to play they will qualify automatically for the 2017 Women's World Cup, of which they are hosts.England have now won all five of their ODIs against Pakistan and will look to go 2-0 up in three-match series when the teams meet again at Worcester on Wednesday.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BRISTOL: Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield produced another dazzling opening partnership of 147 - England Women's highest stand in T20s - to set up a 68-run victory in the first T20 at Bristol.Beaumont made 82 off 53 balls and Winfield 74 off 45 to lead England to their highest total in the format. It followed their 235-run opening stand in the second ODI at New Road when they both hit centuries.Beaumont reached her fifty off 30 balls, and having moved to 82 with nearly five overs remaining had time to score England's first T20I century before falling lbw as she attempted a reverse-sweep, meaning Charlotte Edwards' unbeaten 92, against Australia at Hobart, remained Englands best.Like Beaumont, Winfield struck 10 fours and also a six off Sadia Yousuf and her final score equalled her career-best, having also made 74 against South Africa in 2014.At 146 for 0 in 15 overs, 200 was within reach for England but the last five overs were not quite as fluent as the first 15. The 16-20-over block had fewer runs - 41 - than the other five-over breakdowns.The final over included a team hat-trick for Pakistan as Nat Sciver edged a swipe, Danni Wyatt was run out and Heather Knight feathered a reverse-sweep to the keeper.A target of 189 was, unsurprisingly, well out of reach for Pakistan and England's bowling was not stretched in defending the target. Four of the wickets fell to full-tosses, the third of them giving 17-year-old debutant Sophie Ecclestone, a left-arm spinner, her first international wicket when Sidra Ameen picked out deep midwicket.Asmavia Iqbal struck some powerful blows to finish as top-scorer -- including the one six of the innings, which was Pakistan's first of the tour - before being bowled by Danielle Hazell in the final over.</td>\n",

Three-hundred is no longer competitive in ODIs.\"So there should be at least one format where bowlers have a better chance of executing their skills and making it more interesting for spectators.\"I don't think it's got much to do with bats, but I'm sure people on the (relevant) panel will be able to look into it.\"Tendulkar's views echoed the sentiments of Australian opener David Warner who said last week that flat pitches rather than bats with thicker edges are the reason batsmen have the upper hand in test cricket.Tendulkar was part of the panel that recommended Anil Kumble for the India coach's job and he expects the team to benefit from the vast experience of the former leg-spinner.\"A fabulous player, a hard competitor and will not make any compromises on the field,\" Tendulkar told ESPNcricinfo.\"He will be out there to win each and every moment.\"He played for almost 20 years, so there is plenty to share. I'll just tell the players to grasp as much information from Anil as possible.\"Kumble, who came out to bowl with a bandaged jaw in a 2002 Antigua test, can also teach the players how to handle adversity, said Tendulkar.\"There are always big, crunch moments in any match and how to approach those moments is important,\" Tendulkar said.\"In sport, over a period of time what you learn is not every day you are successful, sometimes you have to face failures.\"It is all about being a tough character and be able to stand back on your feet again and to compete the next day. Every day is a fresh day, new beginning. That is something I feel Anil will teach them.\"   \n",

Svensson for his work on monetary policy./><strong>- ´Time for a woman´ -</strong Still more Americans have been named as possible winners: Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their work on financial panic models, or Robert Townsend for his work on risk and insurance in developing economies.Michael Woodford, a monetary theorist currently teaching at Columbia University, and Robert Barro, who researches the factors that determine economic growth, are also mentioned as serious candidates.Women remain largely absent from the list of economics laureates. Only one woman has won the prize -- Elinor Ostrom, in 2009.But French-American Esther Duflo, 43, would be an ideal laureate, according to economist Micael Dahlen, interviewed in Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.\"It´s high time for a woman to get the prize, for someone under the age of retirement to get it, and because her research is groundbreaking in the fields of poverty and economics, among other things,\" he said.The economics prize is the fifth of the six Nobel prizes to be announced this year.Last week, the awards for medicine, physics, and chemistry were announced, as well as the peace prize, which went to Colombia´s President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end a half-century war with the FARC rebels.The final prize, for literature, will be announced Thursday.For that award, the Swedish Academy could tap a superstar novelist such as Philip Roth of the US or Haruki Murakami of Japan, or a lesser-known writer such as Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse or Syrian poet Adonis.The Nobel prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and cheque for eight million Swedish kronor (828,000 euros, $928,000), which the laureates will receive at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10.    \n",

Janeiro: Italy´s Carmine Tommasone on Saturday became the first professional in history to step in to an Olympic boxing ring -- and celebrated by teaching his opponent a harsh lesson in Rio.Tommasone, 32, who came into the lightweight bout with a perfect 15-0 record, simply had too much speed, power and guile for Mexico´s Lindolfo Delgado and was deservedly awarded a unanimous points decision by the judges at ringside.The Italian hurt the taller Mexican, 21, in round two with a clumping overhand right that had Delgado smiling and urging the Italian to bring it on -- begrudging recognition that the punch hurt.He continued to bamboozle Delgado in the third and final round, hitting the Mexican around with combinations that Delgado had no reply to.\"I am very proud,\" Tommasone said of being the first boxing pro at an Olympics.<br/> \"I was asked by my federation to come to the Olympics and I was very happy to do so -- for me, it´s the most important competition in the world.\"The decision to include professionals at the Olympics only came in June and was met with a chorus of disapproval.Only three professionals including Tommasone made it to Rio.    \n",
       "2252  strong>LAHORE: Pakistan's sporting decline has left the vast South Asian nation that once prided itself on producing the world's best hockey and squash players facing up to an Olympics for which none of its athletes have qualified.</strongWhile cricket remains a wildly popular game in Pakistan, a nation of almost 200 million people, most other sports have shrunk in popularity as the successes of the 1980s and early 1990s have become a distant memory.In dilapidated gyms and crumbling sports fields Pakistani athletes lament the dated equipment and obsolete training methods which leave them struggling against foreign foes who adhere to the latest science-based techniques.Female athletes have an even bigger mountain to climb: most young girls in the deeply conservative Muslim nation are pressured by their families to stop exercising in public, while those with family backing face the wrath of their communities.\"We are behind the rest of the world,\" said Inam Butt, a Pakistani wrestling champion who won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. \"Our budget, training and facilities are just nothing. How can we compete?\"Butt, like other athletes, says the future will remain bleak until Pakistan's government starts pouring money into sport.The seven participants due to represent Pakistan at next month's Rio Olympics have all been given wildcard entries and stand \"no chance\" of winning medals, according to Arif Hasan, the Pakistan Olympic Association president. \"They are more or less going for the participation and gaining the experience. Let's hope next time will be better,\" he said.strong>1980s TRAINING METHODS</strong style=\"text-align: left;\">Those in charge of promoting sport in Pakistan despair.The grassroots system is almost non-existent, children in schools rarely play a sport which is not cricket, and top athletes seldom compete against the world's best as cash-strapped federations cannot afford to send them abroad. style=\"text-align: left;\">Waqar Ahmed, deputy director of the Pakistan Sports Board, said federations also cannot afford to hire top coaches familiar with scientific training techniques and end up relying on Pakistani trainers with \"obsolete\" methods from the 1980s. style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Athletes are really frustrated because... the coaches are not literate and they have been teaching what they were taught 30 years back,\" he said. \"Without infrastructure we can do a lot, but without the techniques you cannot win.\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The demise of hockey, Pakistan's national sport, has been painful to watch for an older generation who prospered during the halcyon days between 1960 and 1994, when Pakistan regularly won Olympic gold medals and world championships. style=\"text-align: left;\">Tahir Zaman, Pakistan hockey team coach, said the lack of government support means many young athletes no longer see a future in sports like hockey where top players get $10 per day. Pakistani cricketers, by contrast, are paid $5,000 monthly retainers and make a fortune from sponsorship deals. style=\"text-align: left;\">\"The attraction is not there anymore. The (government) is not offering regular jobs for players,\" said Zaman, who won a bronze playing for Pakistan at the 1992 Olympics. style=\"text-align: left;\">At Lahore's empty 45,000-seat hockey stadium, Pakistani hockey player Hassan Anwar, 21, said that as a teenager his family begged him: \"please don't play hockey if you want a bright future\". style=\"text-align: left;\">The demise of hockey has been mirrored by the decline in the Pakistani squash scene, where young players know all about 1980s legend Jahangir Khan - considered the greatest ever squash player - but none match his bravura on the court. style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>WOMEN HARASSED</strong style=\"text-align: left;\">Pakistan's best known squash player is Maria Toorpakay Wazir, ranked 65 in the world, but to train she spent years dressing and pretending to be a boy in the ultra-conservative tribal areas near Afghanistan. Now she trains abroad. style=\"text-align: left;\">Pakistan Olympic chief Hasan says societal \"barriers are coming down\" for women but many female athletes rue the slow pace of change. style=\"text-align: left;\">At 16, Neelam Riaz's first love was cycling, but her father banned her from training on roads as men would stare at her. In response, she took up karate to learn how to fend off men and eventually stumbled on weightlifting. style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Usually in Pakistan girls are discouraged from sports, and often coaches push back,\" said Riaz, 25, who last year became a national champion and Pakistan's first female weightlifter to compete abroad. style=\"text-align: left;\">\"Now my family is happy with me doing weightlifting.\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In a dimly lit Lahore gym, where paint peels off walls, windows are shattered and cobwebs cling to a damp ceiling, Riaz is tutoring 16-year-old Iqra Chanzaib, who is new to weightlifting. style=\"text-align: left;\">Chanzaib wanted to play basketball, but the only hoop near her house was out in the open and full of boys, so one of her pious brothers protested.

In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal. More rain followed and the players did not get back on but South Africa's batsmen had earned their first win over England after 14 attempts.    \n",

Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare. Tammy Beaumont, who had been moved down from opening to the middle, played confidently to finish unbeaten on 21.    \n",

2016 which finished at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday and included Anam of Pakistan as the 12th player, says a press release issued here.The selection panel that chose ICC teams of the ICC World Twenty20 included Geoff Allardice (ICC General Manager Cricket/Chairman), Ian Bishop (former West Indies fast bowler), Nasser Hussain (former England captain), Mel Jones (former Australia womens batter), Sanjay Manjrekar (former India batsman) and Lisa Sthalekar (former Australia womens all rounder).The mens team including 12th man contained four players from England, two players each from India and the West Indies, and one each from Australia, Bangladesh, New Zealand and South Africa while the womens team comprised four players from New Zealand, two players each from Australia, England and the West Indies and one player each from Pakistan and South Africa.The Men team includes Jason Roy (England), Quinton de Kock (South Africa, wicketkeeper), Virat Kohli (India, captain), Joe Root (England), Jos Buttler (England), Shane Watson (Australia), Andre Russell (West Indies), Mitchell Santner (New Zealand), David Willey (England), Samuel Badree (West Indies), Ashish Nehra (India) and 12th man Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh).Women team comprise Suzie Bates (New Zealand), Charlotte Edwards (England), Meg Lanning (Australia), Stafanie Taylor (West Indies, captain), Sophie Devine (New Zealand), Rachel Priest (New Zealand, wicketkeeper), Deandra Dottin (West Indies), Megan Schutt(Australia), Sune Luus (South Africa), Leigh Kasperek (New Zealand), Anya Shrubsole (England) and 12th player Anam Amin (Pakistan).Announcing the squads, ICC General Manager Cricket Geoff Allardice said the experts had a difficult task to select the mens and womens squads from around 400 cricketers who represented the 26 teams.I believe the selectors have chosen two very well balanced sides which are capable of beating any opposition under any conditions, he said.   \n",

match here at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium on Tuesday.After England women captain Charlotte Edwards won the toss and put India women into bat, off-spinner Heather Knight took the new ball and tied India into knots at a slow, spinning pitch.She captured three wickets for 15 runs from her four overs while medium-pacers Anya Shrubsole and Natalie Sciver claimed two for 12 and one for seven, respectively.For India, Harmanpreet Kaur top scored with 26 and captain Mithali Raj made 20 while three more batters got into the double figures.   \n",

Nat Sciver then joined Knight, hitting 27 of the 37 more required at the fall of Beaumont's wicket but contriving to allow Knight to complete her half-century before securing the winning single off Iqbal.There was a nervous moment at the start of England's chase when opener Lauren Winfield was caught at slip off the first ball but though Pakistan's captain, the offspinner Sana Mir, bowled Georgia Elwiss for 12, at 53 for 2 from 10 overs England were already on target for a comfortable win.Pakistan´s 165 all out was built around opener Sidra Ameen´s 52 but none of her team-mates could offer much in the way of support with the bat.It was a day to remember, too, for strike bowler Katherine Brunt, who became only the fourth England player to take 100 ODI wickets.Pakistan's score was their highest in five one-day internationals against England but would have been regarded as disappointing given the platform provided by opener Sidras maiden ODI half-century.The 24-year-old right-hander from Lahore had made more than half her side's runs off the bat when she was fifth out at 106 in the 32nd over but support was lacking from Pakistan's top and middle order and had it not been for a late show of aggression from Sidra Nawaz and Iqbal then England's task would have been even more straightforward.Asked for bat first on a surface that was predictably sluggish after the wet weather that forced this match to be played in its entirety on the designated reserve day, Pakistan struggled to build early momentum.They crawled to 29 for 1 after 10 overs, the wicket that fell being the one that mattered in particular to Brunt, when Javeria Wadood, tempted by some width, edged the first ball of her fourth over and Amy Jones, keeping wicket for England for the first time in almost two-and-a-half years, held the catch.The result means England move into the top four places in the ICC Women's Championship. If they can maintain that position with eight matches to play they will qualify automatically for the 2017 Women's World Cup, of which they are hosts.England have now won all five of their ODIs against Pakistan and will look to go 2-0 up in three-match series when the teams meet again at Worcester on Wednesday.   \n",

It followed their 235-run opening stand in the second ODI at New Road when they both hit centuries.Beaumont reached her fifty off 30 balls, and having moved to 82 with nearly five overs remaining had time to score England's first T20I century before falling lbw as she attempted a reverse-sweep, meaning Charlotte Edwards' unbeaten 92, against Australia at Hobart, remained Englands best.Like Beaumont, Winfield struck 10 fours and also a six off Sadia Yousuf and her final score equalled her career-best, having also made 74 against South Africa in 2014.At 146 for 0 in 15 overs, 200 was within reach for England but the last five overs were not quite as fluent as the first 15. The 16-20-over block had fewer runs - 41 - than the other five-over breakdowns.The final over included a team hat-trick for Pakistan as Nat Sciver edged a swipe, Danni Wyatt was run out and Heather Knight feathered a reverse-sweep to the keeper.A target of 189 was, unsurprisingly, well out of reach for Pakistan and England's bowling was not stretched in defending the target. Four of the wickets fell to full-tosses, the third of them giving 17-year-old debutant Sophie Ecclestone, a left-arm spinner, her first international wicket when Sidra Ameen picked out deep midwicket.Asmavia Iqbal struck some powerful blows to finish as top-scorer -- including the one six of the innings, which was Pakistan's first of the tour - before being bowled by Danielle Hazell in the final over.    \n",

    "Other methods such as those that use word embeddings, sentence embeddings, sentence transformers, large language models (e.g., word2Vec, BERT, T5, LLMs, huggingface models, etc.) may provide better outputs after fine-tuning for the required task (sentiment analysis, summarization, classification, text/image generation, question answering, etc.). However, the computational\n",
    "Other non-traditional approaches may include combining approaches. For example, one may first run clustering algorithm to limit the amount of data and then use a similarity calculation. However, these combined methods would need to be benchmarked to compare performance.\n",

    "In a NLP application, user options can be provided that either provide use of different models and changing parameters or preset options that change parameters. For example, some Generative-AI LLM based tools have provided users with options such as \"creative\" \"balanced\" or \"precise\". Presumably these options change the parameters that affect text generation."
